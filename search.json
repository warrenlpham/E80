    "text": "Older Versions of E80\nE80 serves a critical role in the Harvey Mudd college curriculum and it’s unsurprising that some of Mudd’s best faculty have had ownership of the course. A brief history of E80, courtesy of Erik Spjut on the previous E80 page, is provided below. You can find the previous E80 website, a treasure trove of information, here.\n\nE80, Hammer Time was one of the most successful field laboratory courses of all time. Zee Duron is widely acknowledged as one of the premiere course directors of the 21st Century. But time moves on, fashions change, and people move to other projects. Duron has moved on to administrative work, and he has left E80, The Next Generation to Erik Spjut and Mary Cardenas. The challenges and expectations of this sequel are chronicled in this website. We invite you to explore and enjoy.\n\nThe Harvey Mudd Way\nA key element of the philosophy of the Harvey Mudd College General Engineering education is that there are fundamental principles that are applicable to many engineering disciplines. Experimental Engineering (E80) is a sophomore-level, semester-long required course, which has striven to teach a large subset of these fundamental principles through multiple experiments in a number of engineering disciplines. We are redesigning the Experimental Engineering course to explicitly require learning in multiple engineering disciplines while directing all of the experiments to a final goal: to build, instrument, and fly a small rocket; and analyze and report on the data collected during the flight.\nThe project involves the creation of learning materials, teaching strategies, and equipment for a multidisciplinary experimental engineering course involving the instrumentation and testing of these small model rockets. The project includes the design, acquisition, and testing all of the pedagogy, hardware, and software necessary to implement the revised course. We will conduct the course several times with formal assessment, revise the course in response to that assessment, and distribute the course plans, instrumentation requirements, and pedagogical results to the wider academic community. Our plans and results will be presented on this web site.\n\n\nThe Wider World\nIt is difficult to predict where the commercial space era will take us, but this project will fulfill a need for multidisciplinary engineers interested in aerospace applications. The pedagogical materials can be used at a number of engineering institutions to teach experimental engineering in a multidisciplinary way, not only to the students, but also to faculty (at HMC and other institutions) who may not have industrial or hands-on multidisciplinary engineering experience. The proposed learning workshop for faculty will be a means for disseminating the creative learning materials and teaching strategies. Outreach to local middle schools will introduce rocketry (and the associated mathematics and physics) to a very diverse population; there is a real opportunity to increase the interest in and pursuit of math, science, and engineering by these diverse groups, and to increase the diverse and properly-trained workforce in these areas."

Each of these video sets has an associated online quiz. You must take each of these quizzes individually. You may not talk to other people in order to take the quiz, but they are open book, notes and internet. The one exception to the ‘no people’ rule is that you may speak with a professor to clarify ideas before you open the quiz associated with the lecture set.\nThese quizzes are completed on Canvas.\n\n\n\nSurveys and Team Check-Ins\n\nYou will be called upon to complete surveys at the beginning, middle and end of the class, and each week, you will be asked to complete a team check-in (a quick peer evaluation) for the lab done that week. Completing each of the check-ins is worth 0.5% of your grade, and completing each of the longer surveys is worth 1% of your grade.\nThere are a total of 6 weekly check-ins (from weeks 2 through 7) and they are due each Friday at 3:30 pm.\n\n\n\nLaboratory Submission Sheets\n\nThere are a total of 8 labs in the class: Lab0 through Lab7. You must submit a submission sheet for each of the labs that contains data you collected during the lab. (Though note that in lab0 the Matlab on-ramp deliverable is the submission sheet.) This submission sheet will be evaluated for correctness: it’s a way of assessing whether your experimental procedure was correct during the lab. Each submission sheet you provide will be worth 4% of your final grade.\nThese are group assignments and they are submitted on Canvas. The Matlab onramp for lab 0 is an exception: it is an individual assignment.\n\n\n\nLaboratory Writing Assignments\n\nYou will be required to complete a writing assignment after labs 1-5. The purpose of the writing assignments is to train you in specific aspects of scientific writing: making figures, using tables, equations, etc. These assignments are completed entirely on Friday in the Writing and Reflection section. Each writing assignment will be worth 3% of your final grade, and you submit five assignments for a total of 15%.\nThese are individual assignments and are submitted on Canvas\n\n\n\nTechnical Memorandum\n\nEach student will write an individual technical memorandum on material covered in Lab 6. See the Lab 6 page for more information.\nYou must submit a tech memo to pass the class.\nTech memos are submitted on Canvas.\n\n\n\nFinal Presentation\n\nEach team will make a final presentation during Presentation Days, on Wednesday, May 1st, 2024. A detailed schedule will be posted ASAP. The presentation is 15-minutes long followed by a 10-minute Q&A session. The Final Presentation guidelines and rubric are found on the Final Project page.\nFinal presentations are submitted on Canvas\n\n\n\nFinal Report\n\nA final technical report will be submitted by each team on the results of the final AUV deployments. The report will be graded for both technical content and proper use of technical English. (see also this article.). A rough draft of your final report is due at 11:59 PM on 4/26/24. The final draft is due at 11:59 PM on 5/1/2024. The Final Report guidelines are found on the Final Project page.\nFinal reports are submitted on Canvas.\n\n\n\nParticipation\n\nThe instructors will assign you a participation grade which is determined by their in-lab observations, your peer evaluations, and your regular progress through the project checkoffs."

We enforce these restrictions for three main reasons: (1) to simulate demands that can arise in real-world engineering, (2) to help students internalize the learning goals of the class, and (3) to help keep E80 to a smaller time footprint.\nYou are allowed to work in any way you would like on before a lab (pre-lab) as long as you do not touch any hardware. You may NOT collect data (for your experiment), manipulate or test hardware, populate a protoboard, or use the laboratory equipment outside of your lab hours. However, you may look at datasheets, write software, calculate expected results, prepare Excel sheets to do calculations in lab, ask how equipment works, run your preparations by professors, and pursue a variety of other activities. You can spend as much or as little time desired on the pre-lab activities, but successful teams spend a lot of time and energy before the lab starts.\nThe post-lab period is for reflection, resubmission when it’s allowed, and taking a break from E80. You may NOT collect data, manipulate or test hardware, populate a protoboard, or use the laboratory equipment outside of lab.\nWhen in doubt about whether an activity is acceptable outside of lab, ask.\n\nCooperation Between Teams\nCooperation between teams is limited. The rules for each period of the week (pre-lab, during lab, post-lab and writing and reflection) are below. In this section, the word group will refer to a full team of students during a normal week or a sub-team of students during weeks where teams are split into sub-teams.\n\nPrelab: A group may discuss the lab with another group to make sure they are clear on concepts and understanding. Groups may not share code, writing, or documentation with other groups.\nDuring Lab: Groups cannot work together, discuss concepts or understanding, share data, share code, or share writing. Groups may arrange to swap hardware to debug and test defective parts of an experiment or device, but they should strongly consider elevating their concerns to an instructor if part swaps are necessary or if parts are being destroyed.\nPost-Lab: Groups may work with other groups in the same way as the prelab: they may discuss concepts and understanding (including talking about the scale of measured results from lab).\nWriting and Reflection: Each student should be producing an individual work product and may not exchange code or writing with other students. Data may be shared among a group, but not between groups.\n\nThese work restrictions are relaxed during the final project (after spring break): Groups may work on their robot at any time and may discuss any aspect of their robots with one another (as if the prelab policy always applies)."

Don’t forget to clean up afterwards.\nThis lab is a little different than most E80 labs because we want each team member to individially practice most of the skills. In future labs, it will be imperative to get into the habit of distributing work across team members and working in parallel. Deciding how to break up that work is a great pre-lab exercise, and you’ll be hearing more about prelab soon.\nEvery member of the team should complete the following sections:\n\nBreadboarding\nOscilloscope\nSoldering (though only one person can solder the Teensy, everyone should practice)\nGithub Desktop and Arduino IDE Setup\nArduino Practice\nMATLAB Access\nMATLAB On-ramp\n\nThe remaining sections can be broken into parallel tasks\n\nFrame Assembly (it makes sense to break up frame assembly and motor construction)\nBattery\n\nAnd, of course, every team member should participate in the team forming activity"

Installing MATLAB on your personal computer\nThere is a version of MATLAB that youone can run in the cloud via a browser, but because we’ll be using MATLAB a lot in this class, so we recommend that you install it on your personal computer. To do so, follow these instructions. Please install MATLAB R2023b or later.\nImportant: When you are installing MATLAB, you’ll be asked what packages you want included. For E72, you need at minimum the following toolboxes:\n\nCurve Fitting Toolbox\nOptimization Toolbox\nSignal Processing Toolbox\nSymbolic Math Toolbox\n\nIf you’ve previously installed MATLAB, you can add the packages by going through the installation process again. To see what packages you have installed, type “ver” at the command window. You can also install packages within MATLAB by clicking on Apps, then Get More Apps, typing in the name of the toolbox in the search bar, and making sure Toolboxes and Products is checked under Filter by Type on the left side bar. If you get an error Your administrator has restricted your download access..., first try restarting MATLAB.\nThere are lots of videos on MATLAB online. For example, if you want to know how to use fsolve, you can search “MATLAB fsolve tutorial” on YouTube.\n\n\n2. MATLAB Onramp\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Screenshot of MATLAB Onramp\n\n\nFirst, you will learn some basics of MATLAB using the MATLAB Academy tutorial called Onramp. Note that Onramp does not require you to install MATLAB, since it uses an online programming environment that simulates MATLAB’s look, feel, and functionality.\n\nNavigate to the MATLAB Onramp self-paced online course. You will need to login using the account that you created earlier.\nComplete the following modules of Onramp:\n\nCourse Overview\nCommands\nVectors and Matrices\nImporting Data\nIndexing into and Modifying Arrays\n\n\nFeel free to explore other parts of this too to build your confidence with MATLAB.\nOnce you’ve finished the modules in the list above, take a screenshot of the Course modules pages which shows your progress and green checkmarks next to the segments you’ve completed. You’ll need to submit this screenshot for this assignment.\n\n\n3. MATLAB Plotting Video\nWatch this 17-minute video https://vimeo.com/57954461 to learn how to create various 2-D and 3-D graphs in MATLAB.\nWe strongly recommend that you don’t watch the videos passively. Instead, pause frequently while watching the video so that you can try things out on your own in MATLAB.\n\n\n4. MATLAB Debugging Tips\nWatch this 17-minute video https://vimeo.com/501103844 to learn how to find and fix errors in your MATLAB code. This skill will greatly aid you in all classes that require the use of MATLAB.\nIf you want to try using the debugger yourself with this piece of code, download debugpractice.m.\nTo download the file, you can click the little downward pointing arrow in the toolbard at the top right of the code.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Button to download individual file from the GitHub repository.\n\n\n\n\n5. Practice Debugging in MATLAB\nPractice your MATLAB debugging skills on this script debugme.m, which is supposed to create a matrix like the one below.\nThe code should be able to produce a matrix with a user-specified number of columns. In the diagram below, we show what the output matrix should look like if it has 10 columns. The number of rows in this case would need to be 32, since the matrix has three 10x10 blocks in the middle, sandwiched by the row of ones at the top and row of ones at the bottom.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Desired code output matrix.\n\n\n\nHint: In MATLAB, if you create a matrix with a certain size and then you try to assign an element of that matrix outside of its existing dimensions, MATLAB won’t give you an error. Instead, it will just extend the matrix outward as large as necessary to accommodate that new element."

Use this motherboard assembly document as a guide and add the components. For reference, the schematic for the motherboard is here , the layout is here , and KiCAD design files are here.\nThere are two ways that you can damage your motherboard irreparably during this process, and you should take precautions against each of them. One is soldering components in the wrong position or orientation (e.g., screw terminals facing inward or header on the back side of the board), which is very difficult to rework. Double check that you are using the correct header and try fitting all the pieces together before soldering. The other is flipping power and ground by attaching your battery or power supply leads backwards or soldering the red and black wires to the incorrect terminals on the motherboard. Have an instructor or proctor check your battery connector, and make sure to heed the warnings in the assembly guide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSAFETY QUESTION: What are the two ways I can damage my board in this section?\n\n\n\n\n\nSoldering components in the wrong position or orientation, and attaching battery or power supply leads backwards.\n\n\n\n\nCheckout your motherboard from a professor and find the other parts you need in the parts rack on the central table.\nLabel your board: Before you begin assembly, write your section number, team number and board version on your board.

    "text": "4. Motherboard Validation, IMU Calibration, and IMU Error Measurement\nYour motherboard has a circuit on it called an inertial measurement unit (IMU), specifically an LSM303AGRTR , which allows you to measure acceleration and magnetic fields. This is a useful sensor that we will explore more later in the course. We are just getting started with the sensor in this section by calibrating the output and measuring its noise statistics. This sensor is also useful because you can only measure its output if your motherboard is working correctly. The tests in this section will ensure that your Teensy can: listen to the IMU, write to the SD card, and drive the motors.\nFirst, test your motherboard:\n\nSign out an SD card from an instructor.\nPut your Teensy and your SD card into your motherboard and program the Teensy with your code from Section 3. This sketch will turn on one motor for four seconds if it is working properly, so be sure your motors are clear of any obstructions (especially your hands!) when you run the code.\nProvide power to the Teensy using either your battery or the power supply terminals (be careful with the polarity!). You can use the power supply terminals if your battery is still charging. Several lights should turn on, including PWR LED, the IMU LED, the SD LED, and a small blinking LED on top of the Teensy.\nYou have the option of plugging in your USB cable so you can use the serial monitor to watch the Teensy’s serial output as it runs.\nRemove power from your board (you do not need to remove the USB cable if it’s plugged in).\nTake out the SD card and put it into your computer.\nTake the INF and BIN files off of the SD card and read them according to the following instructions.\n\nThe Teensy creates two files to save data every time it runs: an INF file which contains text and a BIN file which contains your measured data in a binary format.\nSpecial programs are required to decode the binary data, and those programs also depend on having a matching INF file. We provide a MATLAB script for reading SD card data: logreader.m.\nThese links provide sample INF and sample BIN files so you can test the MATLAB scripts during prelab. The sample file is very noisy, so it can’t be used to find answers to the questions later in Section 4.\n\nVerify that you are saving the following data to your SD card: acceleration values from your accelerometer, magnetic field strengths from your magnetometer, roll, pitch and yaw angles calculated from your IMU measurements, and motor PWM values.\nVerify that your motherboard can drive motors by attaching motors to motor ports A, B and C and modifying your code to drive each of them. If your motors are not yet ready, you may measure the voltages at screw terminals A, B and C to observe whether they are being correctly applied by your software.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWarning\n\n\n\nPlease be very careful when connecting or disconnecting the micro USB cable to the Teensy!! Pull or push laterally while holding down the connector with your other hand. They are fragile and can be pulled off the board easily.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou can put your Teensy into programmer mode manually by pressing the button on top of the Teensy. This button won’t reset your program, but instead delete all the code on the Teensy so it can be reprogrammed. If you just want to rerun your current program, remove power from the Teensy (maybe using the black power rocker switch) and then restore power.\n\n\nSecond, analyze the data from your accelerometer:\n\nUse the acceleration due to gravity to figure out the size of one ‘accelerometer unit’ in your saved data: i.e.: if your accelerometer reports a value of 1, how many m/s^2 of acceleration is the accelerometer experiencing?\nFigure out the value the accelerometer reports when it is experiencing zero acceleration on each axis. You may need to run your program a few times while holding the board in different orientations to make each axis zero.\nLay your board flat on its standoffs, then take ten seconds of accelerometer data. Determine the mean, the standard deviation, the standard error, and the 95% confidence bounds for a static acceleration measurement in the z direction."

This figure shows two important details about using penetrator bolts: the threads must point INTO the box and the washer must be OUTSIDE the box.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) Penetrator bolt.\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) Penetrator nut and gasket.\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) Project box with penetrator bolt assembly.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Project box and penetrator bolt details\n\n\nThese penetrators have six wires passing through them because your AUV will use three motors, whcih you must prepare.\n\nLook through the stock of motors and select three motors. You may cut them off the used E79 umbilicals if the standalone motor box does not have any useful motors for you. If necessary, you can prep new motors as you did in E79, but your time will be very limited if you must build motors. Instructions can be found here.\nTest your motors using a power supply to make sure they work:\n\nIf the current draw during this test is more than 500 mA, then the friction in your motor is likely to severely limit your top speed; consider debugging it.\n\nSelecting motors that have similar current draws may simplify your software because the motors will exert similar thrusts at the same level of applied PWM.\nMake sure your motors still work when they are submerged in water.\n\nSolder the leads of your three motors. Your motors will be OUTSIDE of the box, so your solder joints will need to be waterproofed with heat shrink tuing. After putting heat shrink on your wires, solder the motor leads to the twisted pair on the non-threaded side of your penetrator bolt. Finish Waterproofing your solder joints with heat shrink tubing.\nTest that all three motors work when the waterproofed solder joints are underwater."

To do this, it helps to know the mass of your robot, and that the robot (including motors and two 1.25’’ foam blocks, but not including the watertight box) has a buoyancy force measured to be approximately 10 N. You can do this approximately in prelab with a guess at your robot’s mass.\nSelect weights for ballasting. Pictures of some of the weights we have available are in FIGURE X. Be mindful that their distribution inside of your payload box could affect the resting pitch, yaw or roll of the robot. It may be useful to adjust the resting buoyancy, pitch, yaw, and roll of your robot with the waterproof box before attempting the obstacle course in section 7.\nProtect against metal shorts. Many of the weights we use are metal, so they can short the back of your motherboard. Make sure the back of your motherboard is covered with insulating foam or electrical tape before setting it on top of your ballast. We also recommend wrapping your ballast in plastic wrap. PICTURE"

Compare that prediction to your measured data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThis comparison is a good example of how E79 can be applied and a good example of how to compare experimental data to theory. The comparison also can be affected by differences between your motors compared and this motor curve, and that variability makes another case for using closed loop control."

Electrical instruments and op-amps are used in every lab in this course, so we are doing this lab to build your toolkit for making experimental measurements. Another goal of the lab is for you to practice error analysis and propagation.\nThis lab will be completed in sub-teams of two students. Before the lab you must decide how you will split your team. Two other labs (labs 3, 4 and 5) will also be completed as sub-teams, and you must use a different sub-team for each of these labs. Each sub-team will be responsible for its own submission sheet. Pre-lab work may still be carried out with your whole team, but be sure each sub-team is ready to tackle the in-lab work independently. Even though your team will be split into two sub-teams, you will only have access to one motherboard/Teensy assembly. Plan your work carefully so that you share it equitably.\nFor pre-lab purposes, a sample submission sheet that contains all of the questions and requirements on the submission sheet is here. Writing software and processing simulated data sets is allowed and, in fact, encouraged during the pre-lab period. Two documents from previous iterations of E80 Auntie Spark’s Guide to breadboards and Uncle Sparky’s guide to Voltage, Current, and Resistance Measurements are helpful prelab reads."

In this section you will take your first analog measurement with the Teensy. Teensy measurements will be used frequently in this lab and the next. Always connect to your Teensy pins through the E80 motherboard, which has protection circuits designed to prevent damage to the Teensy.\nYou will use two different pieces of software to log data from the Teensy in this section: A program on your Teensy (using Arduino code) which will sample data and a MATLAB program which will interpret serial data sent by your Teensy. These programs record input from input A0, which is identified on the silk screen on the back of your motherboard. Attach a wire to the empty hole on your motherboard which is connected to this pin (male-male jumper wires work OK) but DO NOT solder it in place. We will solder a header there later, and desoldering a wire will make that more difficult. You will also need a connection between your motherboard ground and your signal generator ground.\nConnect a 200 Hz, 1 Vpp, +0.4 V offset signal from a signal generator to the analog pin and run the following sketch on your Teensy: matlablogging.ino. While matlablogging.ino is running and the Teensy is connected by USB, use matlablogging.m to receive a vector of data from the Teensy.\nYou may need to modify the function so that it points at the COM port which is correct for your Teensy. The MATLAB program can’t access your COM port if the Arduino serial monitor is open, so be sure that it is closed. Sometimes COM ports get stuck in unusual states and MATLAB can’t access them. Closing all of your programs will usually fix this problem.\nWhat is the sample rate achieved by matlablogging.ino? What is the relation between the values recorded by matlablogging.ino and the voltage applied to the pin? (i.e.: how many volts is one “Teensy Unit”?)\nWhat happens when the voltage on the Teensy pin is less than zero volts?\nNow change your input signal such that you are measuring a 175 kHz, 1 Vpp, +0.6 V offset signal. What signal does your Teensy observe? Why? (Hint: you may need to think back to some parts of E79 to figure this one out.)\nFOR MACs:\n\nThe serial port (COM) can be found by going to Tools -&gt; Ports in the Arduino IDE or by calling ls /dev/ in the terminal and looking for a file of the form: /dev/tty.XYZABCDEF\nIn the matlablogging.ino file, if you don’t see any output on the serial port, you may need to comment out these two lines and re-upload the program to the Teensy\nwhile(!Serial.available()) {\nSerial.println(“Waiting…”); }"

They both behave in exactly the same way, and when used incorrectly, you will find a factor of 2 or 1/2 in your measurements that you can’t explain.\nWe strongly recommend that you use the function generator built into your oscilloscope but bench top signal generators are available in the electronics lab.\nBefore you begin, make sure that the “Output Load” setting of your waveform generator is set to High-Z. Instructions adjusting the output load setting on both the oscilloscope and bench top signal generators are here. Set the frequency of your signal generator to 200 Hz, the amplitude to 0.6 Vpp, and the offset to 0.0 V.\n\nWhat is the amplitude of the sine wave as measured by the Teensy logging pin, Elenco, and oscilloscope?

Are the measurement accuracies within the manufacturer’s specifications?\nDo not adjust the amplitude (don’t turn any of the knobs or push any of the buttons that affect amplitude), but reset “Output Load” to “50 Ω” or “OUT TERM” to “50 OHM,” record the Vpp displayed on the oscilloscope waveform generator or stand-alone function generator and repeat your measurements with the Elenco and ’scope.

    "text": "4. Oscilloscope Probes\nIn this section you will investigate the difference between 1X and 10X oscilloscope probes and explore why these probes might be used. Unusually, we’ll give you a hint at the answer: the output impedance of the oscilloscope probe forms a resistive divider with the input impedance of the oscilloscope itself. Knowing this should make the calculations (with uncertainty) for questions 2, 3 and 4 easier.\nAs alluded to above, oscilloscope probes come typically with two settings: 1X and 10X. Oscilloscopes are designed to match these settings to make it easier to read out results, so oscilloscopes usually permit you to enter the setting of the probe you are currently using. For example, our oscilloscopes permit you to enter any setting (in a 2, 5, 10 order) from 0.1X to 100X. To enter the probe setting, push the channel button for the channel you’re using, e.g., push the (1) button for channel 1. Then push the button below the Probe menu item. Rotate the settings knob until the desired setting is displayed and push the settings knob.\nWe recommend you normally use the grayish probes kept in the drawer beneath the work surface. They are 10X probes and can’t be set to any other setting. However, for this section, find one of the black probes that can be switched between 1X and 10X.\n\nMeasure (don’t just look it up) and record the DC impedance (the resistance) of the scope probes on both 1X and 10X settings (most easily accomplished by connecting the probe tip to the ground clip with a wire and connecting the probe BNC connector to a BNC Female to Double Banana Plug adaptor and then directly into the Elenco), and then answer questions 2 through 4. Don’t measure the input impedance of the scope itself, recall you looked it up for Section 2.\nWhat is the input impedance of the scope (meaning the scope and probe together, not just the probe by itself) when the probe is on the 1X setting?\nWhat is the input impedance of the scope (meaning the scope and probe together, not just the probe by itself) when the probe is on the 10X setting?\nDoes the 10X setting have any effect on the measured voltage? Why?\n\nUnless you have a _very _specific need to do something else, always make oscilloscope measurements with a 10X scope probe, and with the scope channel programmed to 10X probe mode. Never use an oscilloscope probe to feed a signal from the signal generator (either on the oscilloscope or stand alone) to a circuit."

    "section": "5. Source and Load Impedance",
    "text": "5. Source and Load Impedance\nThis section is to give you practice in accounting for both source and load impedances and for doing error propagation. Each component, such as a resistor, has an uncertainty specified by the manufacturer, such as ±1% for resistors and ±10% for capacitors. Each generating instrument or measurement instrument has a specified accuracy, which you looked up in Section 2. For the circuit shown here, and for each of the values of Z1 and Z2 and the measuring instruments in the table here, calculate the expected output voltages with confidence intervals accounting for both components and instruments. Assume the resistors are 5% resistors. Note that these analytical calculations can (and should) be made during prelab. Now, build the actual circuit as (still) shown here on your own protoboard for each of the values of Z1 and Z2 in the table as (still) listed here. Measure and record each component value with uncertainty using the Elenco. Generate the input voltage using a signal generator and measure the output voltage with each of the instruments in the table. Now redo the expected calculations using your measured component values. Explain any differences between your measured voltages and your two sets of predicted voltages. Do the measured voltages lie within the predicted confidence intervals? Are there any lessons here on how best to increase the accuracy of predicted measurements?\nYou might find it convenient to build all the circuits at once, neatly on your protoboard, but be careful that you don’t accidentally use the power busses to build a circuit that doesn’t match this schematic. Similarly, be sure you don’t connect any outputs which should not be connected. It is good practice to trim the resistors with wire cutters so that they lie neatly on the protoboard.\n    Note: If Case (D) is giving you problems, try just twisting the components together and measuring things off of the protoboard. The leakage current is fairly high on the protoboard, and it may interfere with your measurements. \n\n\n    Note: For Case (E) you may have to get creative with BNC adaptors and other components to make the circuits. A 10X probe will clearly not lie flat on a breadboard."

For example, use a coaxial cable with BNC connectors from the signal generator and then put spring-loaded mini-clips on the other end. Connect the mini clips to your circuit input and ground.\nIf you are using dual supplies for your op-amps, have three power busses: V+ connected to the +20 V output on your power supply, V– connected to the –20 V output on your power supply, and GND connected to the COM output on the power supply. You can adjust your supply voltage to be anything from ±1 V to ±15 V depending on what chips you are using.\nIf you are using a single supply for your op-amps, have two power busses: V+ connected to the +20 V output on your power supply, and GND connected to the COM output on the power supply. You can adjust your supply voltage to be anything from +1 V to +15 V depending on what chips you are using.\nColor code your wiring. A common practice is to use red for V+ power, black for V– power, green for ground, and white or blue for signal lines. If you have a rat’s nest of all red wires, neither the professors nor the proctors (nor you for that matter) will be able to figure out what goes where.\n\nIn standard practice, op-amps are shown in schematics without the power connections. However, you must supply power to the power pins or the op-amps won’t work! For reference,this circuit shows the power connected to the op-amp.\nYou may have noticed that the circuit has many capacitors connected to its power rails. These are called decoupling or bypass capacitors and they help to stabilize (in a feedback sense) the operational amplifier. The high gain of operational amplifiers can cause op-amps to interact with long power busses to cause oscillations. This manifests as intermittent, large noise in the output of the circuit. You can almost totally eliminate this issue by placing bypass capacitors between the power supply pins and ground as close as physically possible to each op-amp.\nStandard practice recommends both a 10 µF electrolytic capacitor and a 0.1 µF standard capacitor. For E80 you can get away with just the 0.1 µF standard capacitor. If you use electrolytic capacitors, remember that they are polar and if you put them in backwards they won’t work and may explode.\nFor dual supplies the capacitors run between V+ and ground, and V– and ground. For single-sided supplies, they run between V+ and ground. The circuit below shows a unity-gain buffer amp with dual power supplies and bypass capacitors."

    "text": "0. Introduction\nThe purpose of this lab is to use operational amplifiers to build a turbidity meter, a sensor that measures physical quantities that are often of interest in the ocean. The lab will require sensor design, circuit design and experiment design. Extra credit sections offer the opportunity to explore many other interesting marine sensors. The main take away from the laboratory is that operational amplifier circuits can be used for a variety of sensing applications and that careful sensor design is necessary to achieve repeatable results.\nThis lab will be carried out as sub-teams of two. As discussed in the class Home page, teams of 4 will be assigned by the instructor. Before this lab you must decide how you will split your team. Two other labs will also be completed as sub-teams, and you must use a different sub-team for each of these labs. Each sub-team will be responsible for its own version of the lab’s deliverables. Pre-lab work may still be carried out with your whole team but be sure each sub-team is ready to tackle the in-lab work independently. Between lab and Friday (the post-lab period) the two sub-teams in a team may discuss their experiences, but the sub-teams may not share data, code or text with one another.\nIt is up to the sub-team to determine which parts of the lab are done by whom, and at what time during the 4 hours of lab time. A work breakdown showing what each team member intends to work on during the 4-hour lab time is required for entry to the lab. The work breakdown will be submitted on paper to the lab instructor or proctor at the start of lab. Here is an example work breakdown. No hardware can be used outside of lab hours and no real data can be processed outside of lab hours. However, writing software or processing simulated data sets is allowed and, in fact, encouraged during the pre-lab period.\nFor pre-lab purposes, a sample submission sheet that contains all of the questions and requirements on the submission sheet is here.\nYou will work with some expensive hardware in this lab and in many future labs. This hardware needs to be explicitly checked out from a professor or proctor so that we can track where it is. If any hardware that you checked out breaks, then you will need to request a replacement from a professor. You make this request by filling out an error report (paper copies will be in lab). This report needs to be well thought out. Professors will reject reports that don’t represent sufficient testing or thought. You will keep this hardware with you throughout the semester in your storage box.\nThere are four extra credit sections. They would make the lab too long for most teams of two to complete. If you complete the required sections, you may attempt any or all and include the results in a separate written document summarizing your findings. We DO request that you remember the extra credit sections in this lab when deciding on instrumentation for your final project.\nThis lab will often call upon you to prepare solutions or handle chemicals. Though we aren’t working with anything hazardous (or which can’t be flushed down the drain), be sure to observe good chemical hygiene practices and use gloves and goggles when handling chemicals or sensitive equipment. Notably, always use gloves when handling any glassware that will go into the turbidity meter.\nThere are a few resources used in this lab which must be shared. Please respect others and don’t abuse these resources. All the teams in lab are going to have to share a single turbidity meter and beaker of mystery solution. There will be three digital scales available. For Extra Credit 1, we have a limited supply of buffer solutions which must last for all our labs, so don’t pour out more than you need to cover your pH probes and be sure to use the smaller set of beakers."

Be sure to stay within the supply voltage limits you found earlier when powering it. Exceeding the supply voltages is a sure way to destroy the op amp.

    "text": "3. Turbidity Meter Introduction\nTurbidity is an optical measurement which is related to the total undissolved solids in the water, which is an important environmental monitor since undissolved solids can be indicative of eroded runoff, disturbance of the sea floor or other sources of particles. In contrast, salinity (Extra Credit 2) is a measurement related to the total dissolved solids in the water. Because of time constraints we’ve relegated it to Extra Credit 2.\nModern electronic measurements of turbidity are measured by shining light through a sample and measuring transmission — how much light passes directly through — and 90° scattering — how much light bounces off the particles to a sensor located at 90° relative to the light source. Devices which measure only 90° scattering are called nephelometers, and devices which measure the ratio of the 90° signal to the transmitted signal are called turbidity meters or turbidimeters. The relative effectiveness of the two devices depends on exactly how many solids are in the water.\nThe device you build will compare transmission against 90° scattering to make a prediction of turbidity. You will use an IR1503 IR LED as a light source and two OP950 IR photodiodes as sensors. Why use IR instead of colored light? (Hint: what if the suspended particles were a mix of red clay and green organic matter?) What is the emission wavelength of the IR1503? What is the wavelengths of peak sensitivity of the OP950? This reference provides background information on LEDs and photodiodes. Note that IR LEDs are invisible to the human eye. You’ll need a photodiode or an IR-sensitive camera, like some cell-phone cameras, to tell if it is on.\nThis link has some additional information about turbidity, including a picture of some suspensions of different turbidity for visual reference."

    "text": "4. Transimpedance Amplifiers\nThe current through a photodiode is linear in irradiance, so measuring the current passing through a photodiode is equivalent to making a linear measure of incident optical power. Operational amplifiers can help with this, but this is different than the voltage-amplifying operational amplifier configurations that we have observed so far. This schematic, depicts an operational amplifier configuration called a transimpedance amplifier that measures current. Analyze this schematic so that you understand how transimpedance amplifiers work. An equivalent circuit for the photodiode can help when analyzing this circuit: under illumination the photodiode looks like a current source pointing away from the amplifier.\nDesign and test your own transimpedance amplifier using an MCP6004 for your turbidity meter. Configure any unused op amps in the MCP6004 as unity gain buffers with the input connected to ground. Note that flipping the leads on the photodiode reverses the current direction and the sign of the output voltage; if the output voltage appears to be 0 on a single supply op-amp, try flipping the photodiode and see if the voltage appears. The photodiode in the schematic above is correctly oriented. Report the value of R1 that you picked. A quick experiment using only a scope, a photodiode, an LED, and power for the LED (see the next paragraph) might help you to estimate the currents in your system.\nNote: Transimpedance amplifiers can be designed in many ways. The design we are recommending that you use is not the highest-speed design, but it does have excellent low-noise characteristics. High-speed designs will reverse bias the diode to reduce its junction capacitance (a type of parasitic capacitance found in all diodes) and add a capacitor in parallel with the feedback resistor to filter out noise. However, applying the reverse bias makes current flow the other direction, which would require that the op-amp be dual rail or have an offset to ensure correct operation. This design is the simplest for a single-rail system, and it doesn’t lose performance when measuring large, slow signals like ours."

Using the reference information in the datasheet, select resistors such that the 555 timer output has a frequency between 500 Hz and 1 kHz and an output waveform duty cycle (ratio of high time to sum of low time and high time) of 3/5 (60%). Then build your 555 timer and verify that it produces a square wave output. Why are we having you use alternating signals in your LED instead of just using a DC input for the LED and reading the DC outputs of the photodiode circuits?\nLEDs, like all diodes, have an exponential relationship between the voltage applied across them and the current that passes through them. That means applying voltage carelessly can easily blow them up. We are going to fix that by installing a resistor in series with our 555 timer output. You will connect a resistor and the IR1503 in series between the output of the 555 timer and ground. Read the IR1503 datasheet to find the voltage-current relationship for the diode and pick values of Vcc and the series resistor that will result in 20-40 mA of current. Build it, and then check that your LED + 555 timer assembly is working by shining it at a photodiode and observing a signal of appropriate frequency."

The instructions for its use are here. Use a cuvette to hold your solution. You should not need to fill it more than 1/2 full. Place the LED and photodiodes in the fixture, secure the fixture to your bench top (perhaps using the base legs with blue tape, electrical tape, or double-sided tape) and connect the components to their circuits in a reliable manner. Soldering long wires to your components or using female-female jumpers may help, but you may also be able to use a breadboard as a base and put component feet directly into it. (For reference: The Solidworks part for the fixture base is here and the Solidworks part for the fixture cover is here.)\nPrepare a set of solutions of different turbidities using milk and water. Eyedroppers or beakers may help you to add more precise volumes of milk to your solution. Check the turbidities of your solutions using the TU-2016 calibrated laboratory turbidity meter. Be sure to read the instruction manual to familiarize yourself with the operation of the meter before using it. Never touch the glass of the turbidity testing containers with your fingers (why?). You may need to perform a calibration on the laboratory turbidity meter to get best performance, be sure to sanity check the measurements it produces before measuring your sample. DO NOT EVER OPEN THE CALIBRATION STANDARDS.\nMeasure your solutions with your own turbidity measurement setup. Examine the effect of ambient light on your measurements. Plot the ratio of the 90° Vpp to the transmission Vpp against the calibrated turbidity of your solutions (recall that the turbidity is calculated from the ratio of the 90° signal to the transmitted (straight through) signal). Add a line of best fit and appropriate uncertainty measurements."

A first draft of the writing assignment must be uploaded by noon on Friday, and you need to bring a printed copy of your draft to the writing and reflection section on Friday at 1:15 p.m. During the first hour of the writing and reflection, you will engage in a peer editing exercise. The second hour of the Writing and Reflection section is reserved for you to edit your draft to produce a final draft of the writing assignment. This final draft must be uploaded before the end of the Writing and Reflection section on Friday at 3:15 p.m. Since multiple submissions are permitted, and only the last one is graded, you may want to submit a draft at 3 p.m. as insurance. The writing assignment is based on this prompt. This is the peer feedback worksheet.\nNote that the rubric is included in the prompt.\nRecall that no late work is accepted, we will grade whatever is submitted oat the deadlines.\nAfter the writing and reflection section at the end of each week every person (not just one person per team) must submit a team dynamics check-in survey.

You will build a circuit to interact with a pH sensor and calibrate it against buffer solutions.\nYou will be using buffer solutions in this portion of the lab and they are relatively expensive chemicals. Use the smaller 50mL beakers to hold buffer solutions at your station and take pains not to spill any buffer solution when pouring it from the main supply. Buffer solutions may be rinsed down the sink when you are done with them.\nFind a Pasco pH electrode. These electrodes are generally used with interface boxes provided by Pasco (the Pasport system), but we are going to be hooking circuits directly to the BNC connector of the pH probe. The pH probes are delicate instruments, so be sure to always re-cap them in a bath of pH 7 buffer solution and never leave them sitting exposed to air. Rinse them in a bath of deionized water and shake off any excess droplets before returning them to buffer solution.\nThe probes need special care to make repeatable and accurate measurements, so a few experimental tips will help you to get consistent results: stir the probes gently when you first immerse them in a bath, be sure to wait for the probe voltage to stabilize when taking a measurement because their time constants are long, and keep your hands away from the probes during measurement because the unshielded connections are sensitive to noise that can couple in through your body.\nMeasure the output voltage on the BNC connector in pH 4, 7 and 10 buffer solutions with a multimeter. What values do you observe?\nYou are going to attempt to improve the voltage swing achieved with these measurements by using a circuit. Your choice of circuit depends on the output impedance of the pH probe, consult this application note to get a ballpark estimate for the output impedance and report it. Also, read this reference, a handy guide to the operation of pH sensors, and then describe the physical mechanism which explains the value of the output impedance for this sensor.\nUse a TL081 to interface with the pH sensor to achieve a voltage swing of at least 1V between pH 4 and pH 10. What circuit topology did you use and why? Describe your interface circuit.\nMeasure the voltage your interface circuit produces when the pH sensor is immersed in pH 4, 7 and 10 buffer solutions. Use these measurements to make a calibration plot and add a line of best fit with appropriate quantification of uncertainty. Use your sensor and the line of best fit to determine the pH with confidence limits of the mystery solution in the middle of the room. There is only one small flask of mystery solution that should last for all teams in all sections. DO NOT pour the contents of the flask into another beaker! Rinse off your probe in distilled water. Uncap the mystery solution. Test the pH in situ. Remove the electrode and recap the solution. Rinse off your electrode and store it properly."

    "text": "Extra Credit 2. Salinity Measurement\nSalinity is a measure of the total dissolved salt content of water. It is an extremely important and common measurement in oceanographic studies. Salinity measurements are used to track the flow of water and map the hydrological cycle, calibrate acoustic communication links, and understand biological phenomena like algal blooms. In this section you will build a sensor to measure salinity using an inverting operational amplifier. You will prove that it works by calibrating it against saline solutions with different salinity.\nIn order to design your sensor, you need to know reasonable values for what you’re trying to measure. Your sensor will measure conductivity and the measured value will be used to extract salinity. Find the salinity and conductivity of the ocean using any resource you choose. Note that the equivalent circuit model of a saline solution whose value depends on the separation of the probe electrodes and the salt concentration (why?) is a resistor in parallel with a capacitor. We will ignore the capacitor for this extra credit section, but it is critically important in a design for the final project. You may want to read this reference for further information.\nDesign an inverting operational amplifier circuit using one or more TL081 op-amps which has an output voltage that is linear with the conductivity of your solution. Be sure to consider source and load impedances when designing your circuit. Ensure that the output voltage of this circuit will vary over a wide voltage range for the range of saline solutions that you plan to use for calibrating your circuit. This design depends on some of your experimental parameters including the separation of electrodes and the conductivities of the solutions you intend to measure.\nOne thing to be careful of when measuring salinity is that salt, water and electrons will undergo chemical reactions which can deposit metal salts on your electrodes. These salts can form non-conductive films which stop your conductivity measurements. What kind of waveform should you apply to your circuit in order to make a measurement stable over time? This chemistry can also cause your circuit to fail if the electrode area is too small or the voltage applied to the solution is too low.\nPrepare an experimental setup that will allow you to measure the conductivity of salt water. You have access to beakers, wire, electrical tape and digital thermometers. Prepare a set of saline solutions to be used with this setup which are sufficient to prove the sensor is linear. Graduated cylinders would usually be used to measure the volume of water in these solutions. Those are not available to you, so instead you will need to use the digital scales and the well-known relationship between the mass and volume of water. What is that relationship?\nRecord a calibration curve for your sensor which plots the voltage output of your sensor against the concentration of your salt solution in units of grams per liter on logarithmic X and Y axes. Find a line of best fit including appropriate uncertainty measurements. Then use your sensor and your calibration curve to measure the salinity of the mystery salinity solution on the central table.\nNote: You may use this resource to convert from a measured conductivity to salinity and this resource to convert from salinity to conductivity.\nWriteups for this extra credit section are not counted against the page limit of your report.

    "text": "Extra Extra Credit 4. True Synchronous Detection – Only do after Extra Credits 1, 2 and 3.\nIn this section you will do true synchronous detection like you would do when using the Teensy on an AUV. In true synchronous detection, the excitation is generated by a modulated or chopped signal of known (measured) frequency. In our case we’re using the signal generator to modulate the LED. In some cases, a slotted wheel is spun at a known frequency in front of a constant light source to provide the modulated signal. Either hardware or software is used to generate two constant-amplitude signals at the same frequency as the excitation signal. One is a sine wave in phase with the excitation signal and the other is a cosine wave 90° out of phase with the excitation signal. Each measured response signal (in our case the directly transmitted and the scattered signals form the photodiodes) is multiplied (either by analog or digital means) by the sine and the cosine signals. The two resulting signals (per measured input signal) are lowpass filtered with a cutoff frequency of at most the modulation frequency, and perhaps much lower if a great deal of noise reduction is required. The lowpass-filtered signals are then added in quadrature (square root of the sum of the squares of the signals) and if desired, the phase is calculated as atan2(sin signal, cosine signal). In our case, the phase information is not needed, and the ratio of the scattered quadrature signal to the transmitted quadrature signal is used to calculate the turbidity. In practice, lock-in amplifiers are used to recover signals that are -60 dB below the noise floor. In other words, the noise amplitude is 1000 times the signal amplitude.\nFor this extra credit, you need to wire up a connector to input three analog signals to your motherboard (a scaled and shifted reference signal, the 90° scattered signal, and the transmitted signal; all scaled and shifted to fit into the 0-to-3.3 V input range of the Teensy), and then log the three signals onto your microSD card and then modify LockInTest.m to process your results. You may need to consult with a proctor or professor to find out how to wire the motherboard or Teensy for three analog inputs, and for access to the basic robot package, that has code for high-speed data logging to the Teensy.\nWriteups for this extra credit section are not counted against the page limit of your report.

Pre-lab work and a vision of the experiments that you will be conducting will be essential to the successful completion of this lab. As usual, this subteam may not be the same as any other subteam you’ve participated in during the course.\nThere are two extra credit sections. They would make the lab too long for most teams of two to complete. However, in the unlikely event that you complete the required sections, you may attempt either or both and include the results as addenda in your report and submission sheet (see details in the extra credit sections). They are the same experiments as extra credit for Lab 3. You may submit a given extra credit only once, so if you’ve already submitted one or the other, you may not resubmit it for Lab 4.\nThe instructions for this lab are not as detailed as for some of the earlier labs. You are expected to plan out your experiments and fill in the blanks.\nYou will be provided with:\n\nTemperature sensors\nDigital thermometer\nHot water\nA constant-temperature (25°C) water bath\nInsulated containers\nGlass beakers\nBreadboard\nKeysight Infinivision oscilloscope (click here for manual)\nKeysight E3630A power supply (click here for manual)\nElenco multimeter (click here for manual)\nAn AD623ANZ-ND Instrumentation Amplifier (click here for data sheet)\nAccess to resistors and capacitors in the stockroom and E80 lab.\n\nIMPORTANT SAFETY TIP: When using the calibration baths remember that water is an electrical conductor and putting an electronic component that is not waterproofed into water carries some risk. Use appropriate precautions. Waterproofing your sensors using electrical tape,heat-shrink tubing, hot glue or parafilm is essential!\nIMPORTANT SAFETY TIP: Water above 50 °C can cause scalds. Determine safety protocols for working with hot water to avoid spilling it or inadvertently touching it.\nIMPORTANT NOTE: The only constant-temperature bath in the lab is the 25 °C bath in the E80 lab (B171).

    "text": "2. Thermocouples\nOur available thermocouples are Type-E (Omega FF-E-24-SLE-200). The NIST website with information on thermocouples is here. The direct link to the NIST Type-E table is here. The direct link to the NIST Type-E table is here. The NIST page for polynomial coefficients that were used to generate the table (voltage from temperature) is here. The NIST page for the inverse coefficients (temperature from voltage) is here. The Omega website is here. (Warning, Omega website is often very slow). The Omega version of the NIST table is here. The Omega info on thermocouples is here.\nThermocouples generate very small voltages, which must normally be amplified to be read by an oscilloscope, although the DMM does have sufficient range. The easiest way to do the amplification is with an instrumentation amplifier. The one we have available is the Analog Devices AD623ANZ (data sheet here). Pay special attention to the voltage supply range. It can operate with a supply voltage range of ±2.5 V (or 0-to-5 V single sided) to ±6 V (or 0-to-12 V single sided). If you exceed the voltage supply range, you will destroy the chip. The op-amp standard of ±15 V will destroy it immediately. Don’t be tempted. Figure 79 in the data sheet shows the basic circuit for connecting a thermocouple. Note that in Figure 79, the amplifier is powered with a bipolar, not a single-sided supply. It looks like an op-amp, but it is not. You should use a single sided power supply because your AUV will be powered by a battery. In this configuration you must offset your thermocouple to the average of your power supply (e.g., if you supply with 0-to-5 V, your thermocouple should be offset to 2.5 V). This circuit is given to you for reference. Note that the offset utilizes a unity-gain, non-inverting Op-amp configuration to provide a low output impedance for the offset voltage.\nThe simplest way to construct a thermocouple is to use one of the recycled ones. Otherwise, take a 1-foot length of thermocouple wire, strip the wires at one end and twist them firmly together so they make electrical contact. DO NOT USE SOLDER. It will not stick to the wires.\n\nUse the multimeter to measure the output voltage of the thermocouple by itself. Determine the output voltage of the thermocouple at several temperatures and create a Temperature-Voltage curve. Make sure to record the ambient temperature (specifically the temperature at the thermocouple-multimeter junction) and place this information in the figure caption.\n\nDesign and build a circuit to read a thermocouple using the ice bath method discussed in lecture (see Figure 6 of this link, or Figure 2 of this link, or click herefor lecture slides). DO NOT USE SOLDER. USE A GLASS BEAKER FOR YOUR ICE BATH. To get practice for your future data logger, design the circuit to have a gain of 200 and output voltages in the 0-to-5V range. Provide a detailed diagram of your circuit.\n\nTest your circuit at several different temperatures and create a Temperature-Voltage curve.\nHow do your results compare to the Temperature-Voltage curve of the solid-state sensor and the thermistor? (As a reminder, you looked up the data necessary to find these two curves in Section 1. You don’t need to measure temperature-voltage curves for the thermistor or solid-state sensor.)\n\nThe AD623 is expensive ($7/chip), so return undamaged chips to stock."

In this lab, you will use the solid-state temperature sensor for CJC. To use CJC, measure the temperature of the cold junction with the MCP7901A (the Cold Junction sensor). Use the thermocouple table or polynomial to calculate the equivalent thermocouple voltage at that temperature. Then add your measured thermocouple voltage and your calculated voltage (the CJC voltage) together, and then convert the voltage sum to a temperature using the thermocouple table or polynomial.\n\nUse the solid-state sensor for CJC.

The beacon measurements are most easily interpreted in the frequency domain, so you will be using Fourier analysis to understand the behavior of the signals. The purpose of this lab is to demonstrate the power of underwater acoustic measurements and to force you to wrangle early and often with Fourier analysis.\nFor the required portion of the Lab, beacons will be broadcasting sine waves at 9 kHz, 11 kHz, 13 kHz.\nFor the extra credit sections, each team is assigned an acoustic channel, and the team will need to filter out other teams’ measurements in addition to the ambient beacon signals in order to extract useful information. If you attempt these extra credit sections, you will be free to transmit up to 5 W at 14 kHz +1 kHz *(team number)+/- 300 Hz. If you emit at other frequencies while your peers are taking data then you may damage their experiments, so be diligent in controlling the frequency at which you broadcast.\nThese channels are in the audio range, so try to keep your experiments underwater and short lest your peers shout at you scornfully about the high-pitched whine you’re producing. Be aware that your receiver could be overloaded by broadcasters in other channels, so keep an eye on your time domain signal to be sure that it is not clipping.\nWe are using both benchtop electronics and water in this lab, and the two don’t mix, so BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL when putting anything in the water, removing anything from the water or mounting anything near the water. Instructors will stop your experiments if they think they pose a water hazard to equipment.\nFor pre-lab purposes, a sample submission sheet that contains all of the questions and requirements on the submission sheet is here."

Introduction to the FFT\nEven if not every student can have hands on the oscilloscope (as a reminder, the Agilent/Keysight 2024A which has this spec sheet) during this part of the experiment, we would like every student to, at minimum, watch the proceedings. Please carry out this section as a whole group. Also note that much of this section can be predicted and analyzed very accurately in prelab with sample data generated in MATLAB.\nConnect a function generator to an input channel of the oscilloscope. Double check that your oscilloscope channel is DC coupled. Drive an 11 kHz sine wave with an amplitude of 1.5 V and an offset of 0 V into the oscilloscope. Set the time scale of the oscilloscope so that 50 cycles of the signal fit on the screen. Use the math function of the oscilloscope to display the FFT of the signal. Set the span of the FFT to 100 kHz, the center to 50 kHz and the window to rectangular. Look at the FFT produced by the math menu. Is it what you expect?\nDescribe what happens to the FFT when you do each of the following:\n\nIncrease the drive signal’s frequency by 1 kHz.\nChange the drive signal into a square wave. Back up your assertions that this makes sense with a rigorous analytical analysis.\nChange the window from rectangular to Hanning. Back up your assertions that this makes sense with a graphical analysis.\nChange the time scale of the oscilloscope. Explain your results in terms of the sample rate, the number of samples and the total amount of time over which samples have been recorded. What is your oscilloscope’s sample rate? You can find it displayed on the oscilloscope or figure it out from the scope’s datasheet. Note that the sample rate may vary with your time scale: if you are taking a long acquisition, it is set by the size of the oscilloscopes memory – i.e.: your total number of samples is fixed – and if you are taking a short acquisition it is limited by the speed of the sampling circuitry in the oscilloscope.\n\nDrive the square wave signal from item 3 into the oscilloscope, export your data (make sure that the max length option is turned on in your save settings) and then use MATLAB to take the FFT of your data. First take the FFT with no windowing and then use a Hanning window. Does the FFT in MATLAB match the oscilloscope and your analysis?"

    "text": "2. Circuit Interfaces to Microphones\nYou will need to use microphones to pick up sounds in the tank. We will be using a waterproof electret microphone called the CME-1538-100LB. Build the reference circuit for your electret microphone. The reference circuit’s output is AC coupled – which means a capacitor is attached in series with the output – and your oscilloscope probe looks like a large impedance attached to ground. What effects do the coupling capacitor and the probe resistance have when both are in place? Drawing a full circuit model may help to answer that question. Be sure that you consider the effects of the AC coupling circuit at both low and high frequencies. Verify that you can receive signals with your electret microphone by clapping near it. What frequencies in your hand clap signal contain the most energy?\nYou will need to amplify the signal that you receive in the tank to make it visible on your oscilloscope. Build an amplifier with a gain of 100 by cascading two stages that each have a gain of 10. You need to spread your gain over two stages because of an op-amp parameter called the gain-bandwidth product (often abbreviated GBW or GBP). How do you calculate your bandwidth once you know your amplifier’s gain and the GBW? Use a dual-rail op-amp to build these amplifier stages (why?). Record your amplifier schematic in the submission sheet.\nIf your first amplifier stage is a non-inverting amplifier, then add a large resistor (~100k) between the positive amplifier input and ground. You don’t need this resistor if your first stage is an inverting amplifier. This resistor is necessary to prevent the input leakage current in your op-amp from changing your results.\nYou may need to solder leads to this electret microphone to plug it into your breadboard. You should consider twisting the leads together to form twisted pair wire. These wires do not need to be very long. In the tankroom, you will be provided with water-proofed microphones with long leads so that you can dip the microphones into the tank from the work tables."

    "text": "3. Distance Measurement Based On Amplitude Decay from Continuous Wave Beacons\nOne way to locate your robot in the water is to listen to three beacons and calculate your distance to each of them based on the beacon power received at your robot. In this section we are going to create calibration curves which could allow you to trilaterate your robot based on a set of beacons. You will need to put your microphone into the tank, which will require long microphone wires as discussed in the last section.\nThree beacons are installed in the test tank and will be constantly emitting sine waves of approximately 9 kHz, 11 kHz and 13 kHz. Figure out which beacon corresponds to which frequency by taking acoustic measurements in the water. Which beacon corresponds to which frequency? What are their exact frequencies?\nOur goal is to see if we can infer the position of our microphone by measuring the power emitted by the beacons. We have an analytical expectation of how much power we should receive at a given distance from a speaker (what is it?), and you are going to compare that ideal analytical expression to measurements in the noise-limited, high-multipath environment of the tank. You need to be sure that your measurements capture evidence of multipath in the tank, so how closely will you need to space your measurements? (Hint: think about the wavelength of your waves and the size of the tank to predict multipath interference – which is kind of “spatial frequency” – to figure this out. Also, don’t be afraid to look this up on external resources.)\nMove your microphone around in the tank and measure the power to create received voltage vs. distance calibration curves for each beacon. Be sure to test how the orientation of your measurement system affects your received power and take that information into account when recording measurements. The FFT will be important to separate out the contribution of each speaker. Be sure to save and report some examples of the underlying FFT data which confirms that you have taken these measurements.\nMake an analytical calculation of how much voltage you expect to observe. Note that you don’t need to have the transmit power of the beacon or the pressure-to-voltage constant of your microphone (which is linear) to make this model. You can fit an appropriate voltage vs distance function to your data even without knowing these constants. How many parameters will you use to fit your function?\nCompare your measurements against your ideal analytical model by overlaying them on the same plot. Comment on the suitability of amplitude measurements for range finding. Your comment should not conclude that your hardware is not working: your equipment needs to be working well enough to tease out interesting environmental effects.\nAlways connect to your Teensy pins through the E80 motherboard, which has protection circuits designed to prevent damage to the Teensy."

It is an amplifier with an offset, and an E80 MTB is used to digitize your data. While tempting to connect your single analog signal directly to a Teensy, an E80 MTB with protection circuits should be used to prevent damage to the Teensy. Connect your microphone to a Teensy sampling rig, connect the rig to your computer with a micro USB cable and then run E80_Lab05_Teensy_Rig.m in order to retrieve information from the rig. This software uses the Teensy’s analog to digital converter to measure signals received from the microphone attached to the setup. The sample rate on the Teensy is programmable in this software. (The Teensy should already be running E80_Lab05_Teensy_Rig.ino)\n\nUse the software to measure vectors of sample data with sample rates of 10kHz and 100 kHz.\nPlot the magnitude of FFTs of the 10 kHz and 100 kHz sampled data.

The submission sheet is due at the end of the 4-hour lab period and must be uploaded before the end of your lab session at 5:15 pm. Note that only ONE member of each team should access and submit the submission sheet. It is the responsibility of that team member to add the rest of the team’s names to the submission sheet.\nFor pre-lab purposes, a sample submission sheet that contains all of the questions and requirements on the submission sheet is here.\nThe second submission is a writing assignment, usually around 1 page in length. Each writing assignment will be based on a prompt, and must be completed by each student individually; no collaboration is allowed on the text or figures in these assignments, though you may speak among yourselves about concepts in keeping with the collaboration rules of the course. A first draft of the writing assignment must be uploaded by noon on Friday, and you need to bring a printed copy of your draft to the writing and reflection section on Friday at 1:15 p.m. During the first hour of the writing and reflection, you will engage in a peer editing exercise. The second hour of the Writing and Reflection section is reserved for you to edit your draft to produce a final draft of the writing assignment. This final draft must be uploaded before the end of the Writing and Reflection section on Friday at 3:15 p.m. Since multiple submissions are permitted, and only the last one is graded, you may want to submit a draft at 3 p.m. as insurance. The writing assignment is based on this prompt. This is the peer feedback worksheet. Note that you should include relevant calculations to explain the ideal analytical curves on your calibration plots on your submission sheet.\nNote that the rubric is included in the prompt.\nRecall that no late work is accepted, we will grade whatever is submitted at the deadlines.\nAfter the writing and reflection section at the end of each week every person (not just one person per team) must submit a team dynamics check-in survey. These are part of your participation grade. The survey link can be found on the home page."

    "section": "Extra Credit: Distance Measurement Based on Time-of-Flight Measurements",
    "text": "Extra Credit: Distance Measurement Based on Time-of-Flight Measurements\nAnother common acoustic measurement is time-of-flight (ToF) range finding. ToF measurement relies on sending out a specially designed acoustic pulse from a speaker and measuring how long it takes for it to reach a microphone. Often the microphone is measuring reflections of your initial speaker pulse (eg. on a sounding vessel), but we’ll get started by just sending our speaker pulse straight to our microphone.\nYou need to be able to carefully control the signals being sent from your speaker in order to stay in your audio channel while creating a short pulse. Specifically, you will send a burst of sine waves: a small number of sine wave cycles. We can accomplish this by using internally triggered burst modulation, an advanced feature of the old signal generators (the HP/Agilent 33120A). This function is not available on the function generators in your oscilloscope. You can control burst mode by pressing the series of keys shown below. Read the manual for clarification on how these key presses work.\n\nTurn burst modulation mode on: Shift + the ramp/burst button / The text ‘burst’ will be highlighted at the top of the screen.\nTurn burst modulation mode off: Shift + the ramp/burst button / The text ‘burst’ will no longer be highlighted at the top of the screen.\nTurn manual triggering on and internal triggering off: Shift + the TRIG button / The text ‘trig’ will be highlighted at the top of the screen\nTurn manual triggering off and internal triggering on: Shift + the TRIG button / The text ‘trig’ will no longer be highlighted at the top of the screen\nChange the number of cycles sent out in each burst or the burst repetition rate:\nShift + Enter / Screen says “A: Mod Menu,”\nv / Screen says “AM Shape,”\n\n / Screen says \"AM Source,\"\n\n\n / Screen says \"FM Shape,\"\n\n\n / Screen says \"Burst CNT, \"\n\nv / Screen says some number.” OR &gt; / “Burst Rate,” and then V / “some number.”\nEdit the number you see and press enter to save the setting.\n\nYou will be using Dayton DAEX25W-8 Audio Exciters as speakers to convert voltage signals into acoustic signals. These speakers, like most speakers, have very low input impedance. What is their impedance? Calculate the maximum power you could drive into them using one of the old HP/Agilent 33120A signal generators. You need to account for the output impedance of the signal generator in this calculation. Audio amplifiers, like the LM384, help us to bypass this problem. They are designed to drive large amounts of power through speakers. What is the maximum average power an LM384 can drive into a DAEX25W-8?\nWe have created a power amplifier board containing an LM384 to allow you to drive your speakers. Follow these instructions to use the driver board. You only have access to one power supply in the tank room, so you’ll need to power your microphone amplifier off the same rails as the LM384 amplifier board. Be careful not to provide too much voltage to the microphone amplifier.\nYou are measuring in a noisy environment (beacons, other teams, etc), so measuring your received signal will also depend on carefully timing the snapshot that your oscilloscope takes. By gathering data that is synchronized with the signal you are sending and averaging over many samples, you can cancel out signals that are not at the same frequency as the burst repetition rate of your signal. This is called coherent averaging. Set this up using the following steps:\n\nUse a second oscilloscope channel to probe the output of your function generator (or attach the trigger output of your function generator to your scope’s trigger input)\nTrigger your oscilloscope on the channel attached to the output of the function generator (or on the trigger input)\nSet your oscilloscope to normal mode acquisition (so that it will only capture a new screen of data when it receives a trigger) and adjust the horizontal position of your oscilloscope trigger so that you don’t waste samples recording data before you send out a burst.\n\nTurn on averaging on your oscilloscope using the Acquisition/Mode button.\n\nAffix your speaker to the wall and move your microphone to different distances away from it. Measure the time of flight to your receiver to create a calibration curve of distance vs. measured time of flight. Include an ideal analytical calculation of time-of-flight vs. distance on your calibration curve and compare it to your data. How long should a sound wave take to propagate from your speaker to the other side of the pool? How long for a round trip? A schematic of the test tank can be found here. If you’re feeling particularly bold, you can try putting your speaker next to your microphone to measure a reflection off of something.\nYou may refer to this picture of an example range finding setup. As mentioned in the introduction, it is extremely important that your electronics and the tank water are not mixed. Use tape to hold electronics down so they can’t fall into the tank, and keep bench top equipment as far from the tank edge as possible. Always dry your test apparatus with a towel as you remove it from the water and be mindful of nearby electrical setups. This is an opportunity for some careful mechanical design: a little PVC can go a long way towards making your setup work well. Include one to three pictures of your experimental setup on the table and pool edge in your submission sheet. These pictures will be graded on safety and quality of construction."

    "text": "Extra Credit: Velocity Detection from Doppler Shift\nIt is possible to use more complex modulation of the signal that your speaker emits to learn more about your robot. In this section you will use a frequency modulated sine wave to measure the velocity of your robot by leveraging the Doppler effect. This type of measurement is called a frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) measurement because, unlike your time of flight experiment, you are not sending out bursts of signal.\nUse the signal generator to generate a triangle frequency modulated FMCW signal to drive into your speaker. Instructions to do so can be found in the manual. Set the frequency deviation to fill your channel, the modulation frequency to 10 Hz, and the modulation shape to be a triangle.\nYou will need a “true” measurement of velocity to compare against your Doppler measured velocity. We will record video of your robot and analyze it with frame tracking software. VLC works well as capture software, and we recommend tracker for tracking software (though some students have used video-physics). Attach one of the USB web cameras to your computer and build a PVC frame so that it has a top-down view of your robot. Make sure a length reference like a meter stick is visible in the image that you capture. Attach a brightly colored piece of pool noodle to your robot so that it is visible above the water. This will enable you to use auto tracking features in the video analysis software. Test your image capture / velocity measurement system before deploying your robot to be sure that it is working.\nUse a claw hand or a piece of PVC to move your receiver through the water while driving the transmitter with your FMCW wave and recording the received audio. Also record video of the test using your image tracking system. It’s easiest to carry out your recordings by taking a very long acquisition on the oscilloscope which you start manually by pressing the force trigger button.\nUse the instructions in this document to process your received audio and extract the velocity as a function of time from your received FMCW. Bear in mind that you need to isolate your velocity signal before doing any signal processing, so don’t be afraid to take an FFT and filter out other channels before processing your data. Also extract velocity from your recorded video. Generate a plot comparing your Doppler velocity against the velocity measured using your image capture system.\nWriteups for this extra credit section are not counted against the page limit of your report. You may submit this as an additional document labeled “lab 5 doppler extra credit addendum.”"

    "text": "A Note for the Project:\nYou won’t be able to use our audio amplifier boards during the final project, but it’s pretty easy to whip up your own LM384 on your protoboard. You can find the reference design for a typical 5 W amplifier in the LM384 datasheet. This reference design involves using a potentiometer for volume control, which you can probably replace with a fixed divider or omit depending on your design. Place an extra 4.7 µF bypass capacitor on the supply rails (not the bypass pin) in addition to your normal bypassing. Your amplifier will be unstable without this extra capacitor, so it may be educational to remove the capacitor and observe the amplifier output to understand exactly what bypassing does for you.\nNotice this design has a capacitor in series with the speaker. This is done for two reasons: speakers can be damaged by DC current, and the audio response of the speaker is linked to relatively high frequency oscillations. The capacitor lets high frequencies through and stops DC. This technique of driving an output through a series capacitor is called AC coupling. You’ll probably drive the input from a Teensy, but this input likes to have zero centered input signals, so we recommend AC coupling the input too."

    "section": "3. Magnetometer Calibration",
    "text": "3. Magnetometer Calibration\nA magnetometer measures the earth’s magnetic field, so it can be used as a compass to sense your robot’s heading. Read this article describing how it works. We have a magnetometer integrated into our IMU.\nEvery magnetometer has errors in its measurement, which can be byproducts of manufacturing or of local magnetic disturbances (eg: the magnetic declination is -10.52 degrees at Mudd). You need to calibrate those errors out before you can trust your magnetometer results. This article on magnetometer calibration is a good summary of the process.\nTake your robot outside, far from buildings, and log your magnetometer data while your robot is held upright and you slowly (over ~10s) rotate 360 degrees while standing in place. Log your data. Next, program your Teensy with our magnetic calibration software – Mag_Calibration.ino – and use Mag_Calibration.m to extract the hard and soft iron correction coefficients. You will need MATLAB version 2018b or later to run this code. Save the figure generated by Mag_Calibration.m to your submission sheet. Update SensorIMU.h, which is included in the IMU reading library SensorIMU.cpp, with these coefficients. Turn in a circle again outside and save your magnetometer readings again. Generate the following two plots: a scatter plot of mx vs. my where your calibrated and uncalibrated data are superimposed (what units are the axes?), and a plot of heading vs. time for both your calibrated and uncalibrated data.\nIn this class we are using east-north-up local tangent plane coordinates. This means that you need to convert the heading from the IMU, which should have 0 degrees due North and positive angle in the CW direction, to yaw angles where 0 degrees points in the positive X direction (due East), and positive angles are in the CCW direction. If 0 degrees doesn’t face perfectly East, (which is location dependent due to abnormalities in the Earth’s magnetic field), you can add an offset angle to ensure it does. Put code to make this conversion in XYStateEstimator.cpp. Include the code you use to convert from heading to yaw in your submission sheet.\n\nNote: the most common programming mistakes that we see are messing up units (is this angle in degrees or radians?) and failing to re-map angles between -\\(\\pi\\) and \\(\\pi\\) after they are calculated (3\\(\\pi\\)/2 will crash a lot of your code unless you’re very careful)."

    "text": "4. Position Measurements via GPS\nIntegrate the Adafruit Ultimate GPS into the board stack so that the Teensy has access to GPS measurements: First, solder a 9x1 female header pin row onto the motherboard at the position labelled GPS (see Lab 1 for details). Second, solder male header pins to the BOTTOM of the GPS breakout board. Be sure to get the orientation correct, (see image here). Note that screws, nuts, and standoffs may help secure the GPS breakout board to the motherboard.\nTest your GPS Sensor integration by opening the serial monitor while E80_Lab_07.ino is running. Make sure your battery is plugged into the stack (your GPS is powered off the battery and not off the same USB connection that powers your Teensy), and that you are outside the building so that you can get GPS lock and measurements.\nModify the library file named XYStateEstimator.cpp so that it calculates the x,y position (in meters) of the board stack with respect to a Cartesian coordinate frame whose origin is at ( 34.106465°, -117.712488°). Consult the XYStateEstimator.h file to see what variables you have available. Design your coordinate frame so the X axis points due East and the Y axis points due North. The code to make this transformation should be placed in the function named XYStateEstimator::updateState(), which is already in the file. Note, the x,y positions will be stored in the variables state.x and state.y\nIt may help to first make sure you are aware of how longitude and latitude work. This link is helpful and has a nice image to help visualize the coordinate system. There are several algorithms that have been used to convert longitude-latitude coordinates to x-y coordinates. There is the Vincenty formula, the Haversine equation, and linear transformations that simply scale the coordinates. The first two methods incorporate the curvature of the earth which is important when the vehicle is traveling many kilometers. Scaling methods are easier, but can only be used if distances are short. A good reference can be found here.\nWe will use a modified version of the Forward Equirectangular Projection, where we multiply by the radius of curvature R_earth. We note that the conversion of latitude to y is easier and if we assume the earth is a sphere (which it is to within ±0.25%), so we can use the relationship between the distance along an arc’s edge, the radius of the arc, and the angle, (e.g. state.y = R_earthlatitudeChange). To calculate x, note that it is a function of latitude, (e.g. state.x=R_earthlongituteChange*cos(latitude at origin)\nTo test that your sketch is functioning well, log the x,y positions (they are logged by default in the sample code) as you walk from the coordinate system origin to Foothill Blvd. Walk along the sidewalk East towards Shanahan. Then walk South between Shanahan and Parsons. Cut West back to Parson’s building and end at the origin. The path is illustrated here. It takes time (sometimes a few minutes) before the GPS receiver gets a lock on the signals from the satellites. The GPS lock LED can help you identify if your board has achieved lock. You may want to have the serial monitor open (and print x,y to the screen) when walking the course: this will inform you if your conversion makes sense. Using MATLAB, plot the logged x,y positions from the path. Only plot the x,y points for which the GPS has a lock on satellites.\n\nNote: See above note on common programming errors. They really crop up here."

    "section": "5. P Control on Depth",
    "text": "5. P Control on Depth\nIn order to implement closed loop depth control with your AUV, it first needs to be able to sense its current depth. To measure depth, you will be using a pressure sensor adapter PCB (picture, schematic, layout, KiCAD) to connect a pressure sensor to pin A0 of your Teensy. This adapter can be found on the central table.\nIn the library file named ZStateEstimator.cpp, in the function called ZStateEstimator::updateState(), you can see that the z position (depth) of the robot is calculated using the function’s input pressure_signal. The main loop() of the Arduino code is where z_state_estimator.updateState() is called. By reviewing this loop(), you can see that this pressure_signal input is receiving the output of analogRead(PRESSURE_PIN). analogRead() is an Arduino function that reads the value of a specified pin, and PRESSURE_PIN is a variable set in Pinouts.h, currently set to pin A0 (pin 14) of the Teensy. The pressure_signal input provides the pressure sensor signal in Teensy units. The ZStateEstimator::updateState() function then converts from Teensy units to Volts, then finally converts from Volts to depth [m] using the variables depthCal_slope and depthCal_intercept. This depth measurement is stored in state.z.\nThe depthCal_slope and depthCal_intercept are not calibrated to your pressure sensor, so you will have to update them. Find where these variables are defined in the library file called ZStateEstimator.h (which is included in ZStateEstimator.cpp), and write down the default values and line numbers for these variables. After finding the calibration slope and intercept for your pressure sensor, this is where you will update them.\n\nNote: Navigating the code like this is helpful in understanding the interaction between the .h files, the .cpp files, and the Arduino sketch. The .h files are the interfaces, they hold information on variables that are used in other files and the functions of the .cpp files of the same name; the .cpp files are the implementations of these functions where the variables held in .h files are used; and the sketch is the top level instructions where some of these functions and variables are used to implement the desired behavior of the robot.\n\nTo calibrate your pressure sensor, get a pressure sensor adapter PCB and a pressure sensor, a graduated cylinder and a meter stick with pressure tubing. Edit ZStateEstmiator::updateState() by uncommenting the two lines of code below the calculation of the z position that initialize a string and print a string with the function printer.printMessage(). The pressure sensor voltage should now appear in the serial monitor, and you will use that display to calibrate your pressure sensor.\nAttach the pressure tube to the pressure sensor and attach the adapter PCB to the motherboard, then plug the pressure sensor into the adapter. Open the serial monitor while E80_Lab_07.ino is running and record both depth and voltage readings. Measure at least seven evenly spaced depths (measured in meters) between the water level and the bottom of the cylinder. Plot the data in order to make a calibration curve and determine the equation of the line of best fit, then update the calibration slope and intercept in ZStateEstimator.h.\nAdd a Proportional depth control system to your robot by modifying the DepthControl.cpp file. Add the following steps:\n\nSet the variable depth_des to the desired depth, which can be found in the wayPoints array at the index currentWayPoint (i.e. wayPoints[currentWayPoint]).\nCalculate the current depth depth using the state.z variable, which was calculated in ZStateEstimator::updateState().\nCalculate the error e as the difference between depth_des and depth. Pay attention to the order you subtract these (How will this affect the control effort?).\nSet the vertical motor control effort uV to be the product of the control gain Kp and the error e. The default value of Kp is 80, but you can change it if your motor is too weak or too strong.\nBound the vertical control effort between -200 and 200. These are empirical values that work well for most situations. Depending on your motor, you may need to go beyond these limits. You can go up to a maximum of +/- 250.\n\nTest your depth P control using the meter stick with tubing and the graduated cylinder. Attach the pressure tubing to your pressure sensor (careful not to bend the pressure sensor - it’ll be easier if you take the pressure sensor out of the adapter, attach the tubing, then plug it back in). Then, while E80_Lab_07.ino is running with the serial monitor open, insert the meter stick into the cylinder, keeping an eye on the DepthControl:, Depth_Des:, Depth:, and uV: values printed to the serial monitor. Make sure that the Depth is reporting a similar value to the current depth of the meter stick to confirm that your calibration works. Then watch the control effort uV change as the difference between Depth and Depth_Des changes, making sure it behaves as expected for proportional control.\nFinally, get an E79 umbilical (found in the lab room) and attach it to your robot. Put the motor in the vertical position, and use a ziptie to secure the tube to the frame. Connect the tubing to your pressure sensor and the motor wires to the Motor C port on your motherboard. Test if the umbilical works by running E80_Lab_07.ino while the serial monitor is open. The motor should start spinning to get to the first waypoint at 0.5 meters. Check if it’s rotating in the correct direction; if not, switch the wires on your motherboard (or change the order you subtracted the depth and depth_des to get the error in DepthControl.cpp, or change the sign of Kp). Blow in the pressure tubing and confirm that the depth changes, and that the motor responds to the change in depth.\nOnce everything is tested and working, bring your robot to the tank room. Put it into the tank, run the sketch, and let the robot go to the two depth waypoints at 0.5m and 1m. Keep an eye on the values and messages printed to the serial monitor. Be sure to log your data, then plot the logged uV, depth and depth_des as a function of time.\n\nNote: Be careful with the umbilical, it may not have enough slack for the robot to go down to 1 meter; if that’s the case, you can change the depth waypoints in the setup() function of E80_Lab_07.ino. If your robot’s motor is too strong or too weak, you may need to change your Kp in DepthControl.h.\n\n\n\nNote: You can instruct the robot to stay at each depth waypoint for a specified amount of time by changing the diveDelay variable defined in the setup() function of E80_Lab_07.ino. e.g.: diveDelay = 3000 will tell the robot to wait at each depth waypoint for 3 seconds before continuing."

Go Autonomous\nIn this section you will once again have your robot dive in the tank room using Proportional depth control, but this time you will use your waterproof box to hold your battery, motherboard and pressure sensor on your robot instead of using the umbilical, going completely autonomous.\nYou will need to use a pressure tube penetrator bolt (found in the lab room) so that the pressure sensor inside the box will be able to read the pressure outside the box. You will also need to drill another hole for this pressure penetrator bolt into your waterproof box. Be sure to use a 1/2” step drill bit (which we have in our cupboards) to drill out the hole. Standard drill bits will result in ragged holes that are not watertight. Make sure that the placement of your hole isn’t too close to any protrusions on the surface of the box; You want the rubber washer to be completely flat against the surface.\nNext, you will want to test if your box is waterproofed with the new hole, then add ballast to your robot in order to make it close to neutrally buoyant. Refer to the section on AUV Assembly in Lab 1 for directions on doing this.\nWhen your robot is ready, bring it to the tank room. Upload the sketch, make sure you’re logging your data, close your box and place your AUV in the water. Let your robot dive to the two depth waypoints (0.5) and (1), then include a plot of the uV, depth and depth_des as a function of time in the submission sheet (it should look similar to the submission for section 3). Then change the waypoints and the diveDelay, keeping the values within reason. Run the updated sketch and let your robot dive to the new waypoints, confirming that it’s waiting at each waypoint. Include a plot of the uV, depth and depth_des as a function of time for this run, which should show the depth staying still at each waypoint and the depth_des changing only after the delay is over."

    "text": "Extra Credit 2: Proportional Surface Control\nIn this section you will implement a Proportional surface control system with your AUV using the GPS on your motherboard. Use E80_Lab_07_EC2.ino as the starter code for this portion. You will also interact with two new library files: SurfaceControl.cpp and SurfaceControl.h. Confirm that you can compile and upload the starter code to your Teensy.\nAdd a Proportional surface control system to your robot by modifying the SurfaceControl.cpp file. Add the following steps:\n\nCalculate the desired yaw angle using the atan2 function, i.e. yaw_des = atan2(y_des - y, x_des - x). In this case, (x_des, y_des) is the desired position of the robot.\nCalculate the error e as the difference between yaw_des and the yaw you calculated in section 4.\nSet the control effort u to be a product of the control gain Kp and the error e.\nSet the right and left motor thruster values (uR and uL) to be the avgPower + u and avgPower - u respectively. Start by setting avgPower to be 50. This can be modified later if you want your robot to have faster or slower forward motion.\nMultiply uR and uL by Kr and Kl respectively, (e.g. uR = uR*Kr;). The default values for Kr and Kl are 1.0, but you can change them later if your motors don’t run at the same speed when given the same PWM signal. Bound the control values to be between 0 and 127.\n\nTest your P control by walking the campus in the direction your P control guides you when the path is defined in the code to be the three x,y coordinates (125,-40), (150,-40), (125,-40). This should walk you 25 meters along the centerline of campus (see picture here). Walk at a slow speed , turning in response to the u_R and u_L values printed to the Serial monitor. E.g. if the the values are u_R=45 and u_L = 55, then veer right. Be sure to log your data. Plot the logged path of x, y points, (bonus points if plotted on top of an image of campus). Also plot the angle error and control effort u as a function of time.\nFinally, attach motors to the Motor A and Motor B port and repeat the above experiment, this time obeying your observations of the motor’s rotation rates rather than printed u_R and u_L values. Modify Kr and Kl if necessary to balance your motors. Pay special attention to how motors affect your yaw measurement: they have powerful magnetic fields that are likely to disrupt your experiment if you don’t handle them with care. Include plots of your x,y points, angle and control error."

    "text": "The final project for this class is deploying your AUV in open water in order to complete an experiment of your design. This project offers many opportunities for creativity: there are a wide variety of interesting things in the ocean that can be measured. For example, environmental or scientific quantities (e.g., water quality, distribution of temperature, salinity, turbidity) and observation of marine life are good options, as are engineering properties such as sensor accuracy, battery life, sensor or craft mechanical durability, velocity vs. power, controller accuracy, or measuring the structural strains that large motors apply to the robots. Get creative! We look forward to seeing what you come up with.\nThe minimum requirements of the project are as follows:\n\nYour robot must be autonomously deployed to take measurements without human intervention.\nThe deployment must last at least one minute and the robot must actively control its position during this minute.\nThis deployment must end at a place where the robot can be recovered.\nYour sensor package must be deployed on or from your AUV, either in the water or in the air.\nYour sensor package must use at least three sensors with at least two unique electrical interfaces.\nThe IMU, GPS, and motor current sensors that are already installed on the robot do not count towards this requirement, but they may be used as part of your data collection and analysis.\nAny sensors, including the ones you’ve installed or used as part of any of the labs, are fair game for this project. The extra-credit sections of labs are a good source for sensors.\n\nThis project is structured as a set of cumulative deliverables which will help you gather data in time to complete the project. These deliverables are summarized below. Each deliverable requires that each team be checked off by two faculty members during your usual lab section. The details of what documentation or hardware demonstrations are required for the checkoff each week are included in the sections below. The team needs to check off with their section professor and a second professor. The second professors will be available for some portion of every afternoon and on Friday (Teams from sections 1 and 3 may check off with your 2 section professors). Be prepared for a rigorous design review at each checkoff.\nIn addition to the extra credit sections in the labs, there is a set of reference designs for sensors and equipment. Feel free to use them as the basis for your own sensors and equipment. There are also many Arduino tutorials and an Elegoo User Guide to help you get started with your hardware.\nSensor deployments are intended to take place during weeks 4 and 5 of the project: Week 4 deployment will be at the Bernard Field Station’s pHake Lake during your regular section time and week 5 deployment will be at the Dana Point Baby Beach on Saturday 4/22/2023.\nAfter the deployments, students are responsible for a set of final deliverables: A rough draft of your final report is due at 11:59 PM on 4/28/23. The final draft is due at 11:59 PM on 5/3/2023 (submission will be accepted on Sakai) and a final presentation on 5/3/2023. The requirements for the final deliverables are discussed below.\n\n\n\nDuring the first lab section of your project you will need to produce a project proposal. The project proposal is made up of four parts: a budget indicating what you intend to buy for the project, a one-page maximum written description of your experiment, a detailed schematic showing how you will install your new sensors, and a mechanical drawing showing how you plan to mount or ruggedize the sensors for water submersion. Take a look at this example proposal to see what we’re looking for.\nYou will need to price the sensors and mechanical parts (easiest online) in order to make an accurate budget. You are expected to have selected parts for your experiment before submitting the budget. Selecting these parts will depend on your experimental design: does your motor have enough torque to overcome the surf? Does your pressure sensor have the maximum ratings necessary to achieve the depth you desire? Common vendors include Digikey, McMaster-Carr, JameCo, SparkFun, AdaFruit and many others. The faculty will not approve any budgets greater than $50 (including taxes and shipping). Supplies in the E80 lab don’t count towards your budget limit (and remember that there are some links to get you started on the final set of lecture slides and the section above). Some of the supplies, notably speakers and microphones, are available for temporary checkout for prototyping but not for permanent installation. These supplies are cheap enough that we expect you to buy your own for permanent installation.\nThe one-page description of your project should lay out your scientific and/or engineering goals and describe how your sensor system will help you meet those goals. There are a few specific points that it should address:\n\nIt should answer the question, “Why would anyone do this project?” or “Why should I care about your results?”\nIt should outline your hypothesis and what you’re comparing it to: what is the x of your experiment, what is the y and what two x-y curves are you comparing? If you need to cite literature to establish your scientific relationship, then don’t forget you can access papers through Mudd’s network.\nIt should state the sensors you are using and describe how they relate to your scientific goals. Will they require any exceptional mechanical, electrical or software design?\nIt should convince the reader that you considered a number of design alternatives when you picked your project. The minimum bar for doing this is including five two-line project descriptions for projects that you considered but did not pursue.\nIt should outline requests for specific launch times or locations for your robot. There are two locations we can launch in Dana Point: the public beach and the Ocean Institute pier. We have a limited number of launch slots on the pier: two teams can launch in each half hour slot from 8:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. If your scientific goals would benefit from a particular launch time slot or slots on the pier, then you should request those slots in this project description. If some time slots are oversubscribed, we will award them randomly. We will prioritize giving every team that wants one a deployment off the pier over giving one team multiple deployments.\n\nYour schematic should be detailed and thorough and show every wire, resistor, capacitor (don’t forget bypass capacitors) and power source that you intend to connect in order to get your sensor signals onto your MTB. You should consider the voltage swing each component will provide and carefully design your analog front end and power supply so that these voltages are appropriate for the Teensy. Annotating voltage swings on your schematic is a good way to keep track of these design choices. You will be asked about every component on your schematic, so be prepared to back up your decisions with calculations or reference designs from the datasheets.\nYou may find the design files for the PCBs you will use helpful while coming up with your schematic, so they are linked below. The CAD files for each board are viewable usingKiCAD. Also, consider re-reading the Introduction to the E80 Motherboard document from lab 1.\n\nMotherboard (schematic, layout, CAD files)\nProtoboard (schematic, layout, CAD files)\n\nYou used the motherboard in labs 1, 2 and 7, so you should be familiar with it. All of your new electronics will be assembled on a new board called the protoboard, which has been designed to resemble a breadboard. Note that there are special areas on the protoboard layout for voltage regulators; you have battery power available to your protoboard but no regulated voltage supplies, so you will need to use these areas to add voltage regulators. The screw holes on all of the boards are grounded. Connections from the motherboard to protoboard will be made with a ribbon cable as shown here and here.\nYour mechanical drawings should indicate sensor locations and be sufficient to convince a skeptical professor that your intended mechanical modifications are physically possible. Include approximate calculations - mass, center of gravity, buoyancy, or torque for motors - where appropriate to justify that these modifications serve your experimental goals. Especially include calculations if you think a professor will challenge you on the feasibility of your modification. (“e.g.: Can you really submerge an air filled tank with THAT motor?”) Be sure to look up datasheets for motors if necessary.\nRemember, you have $50 per team to spend towards your project. A few important notes on spending:\n\nAll purchases must be approved by your section instructor, who will initial your purchase requests on the google spreadsheet.\nYou must make all purchases to be shipped to the Engineering Department.\nOnce your section instructor has approved your purchase, the designated purchaser may use the online department form New Purchase Order Request Form to make the purchase request.\nOn the purchase request form, be sure to include your team number and section number.\nPlan for a relatively long lead time, around a week.\nOn the purchase request form, put Professor Brake as the professor to approve the purchase request.\nDO NOT FORGET TAXES AND SHIPPING COSTS WHEN CONSIDERING YOUR BUDGET.\n\nFaculty use this checklist when checking students off for this week, so feel free to review your proposal against that list.\nThis is the list of parts available to you.\n\n\n\nAt the end of the second week of the project you must demonstrate a prototype of your sensors in communication with the Teensy on the motherboard (MTB). Attach the sensors to your MTB (possibly using a breadboard), write software to measure them and design a set of experiments which will allow a professor to observe your sensor’s outputs for known values. Be mindful of your construction techniques: if you do a good job building your circuits this week then you will be ready for your deployments. If you do a bad job, then you will need to do confusing rebuilds. The more sensors you get working this week, the smoother next week will go.\nDuring your checkoff you will be expected to show your professor (preferably) a live demonstration or (if necessary) a set of slides which show your measured data.\nHere is a PDF of the Week 2 check-off list that we will use to evaluate your circuits.\n\n\n\nAfter you have tested all of your sensors (possibly breadboarded) and demonstrated that they work, you need to transfer them to the hardware that will go in your AUV. As discussed in Section 1 above, the available protoboards are PC boards that are laid out like two halves of a breadboard side by side to which you can solder parts. They connect to the motherboard through the multipin connectors and ribbon cable. They are usually the easiest way to ruggedly mount your components for use in your AUV. Consider carefully the proper ways to mount and waterproof so that your sensors function as desired. You do not need to complete your waterproofing and final assembly, but everything should be ruggedly mounted and you want to come as close to the final configuration as possible.\nSome helpful guidelines:\n\nParts like the bypass capacitors and assorted resistors should be soldered directly to the PCB. For more complex parts, such as 16-pin DIP op-amps, it may be wise to solder a socket in place and mount the part in the socket to facilitate replacing them if something goes wrong.\nGood wiring technique and tight layout will make your robot much more reliable and easier to debug.\nYou should use stranded wire whenever the wire will be subject to flexure or bending during use, disassembly or reassembly. It is much less likely to break under strain than solid core wire. As a general rule, when connecting two points on the protoboard use solid wire, when connecting to anything off board, use stranded wire.\nYou may need to make penetrator bolts for this project stage. A method for applying marine epoxy to bolts that have been drilled out can be found here. Remember that marine epoxy needs to dry overnight, so making these bolts requires two days because epoxy is applied twice. Be sure epoxy always dries in a fume hood: staff can show you an appropriate hood to use. We use 1/4” holes for our penetrator bolts and we hold the undrilled bolts in vises while drilling out the central hole. We find that six wires is about the maximum that we can fit into one bolt before the epoxy starts failing. You will also need to drill holes for these penetrator bolts in your project box. Be sure to use 1/2” step drill bits (which we have in our cupboards) to drill out the holes. Standard drill bits will result in ragged holes that are not watertight.\nDefault_Robot.ino, is a good starting point for integrating your sensors with the Teensy. It adds some implements a couple features: logging of the analog pins, an updated diagnostic display, improved GPS resolution, and a few header files that help keep things organized. Be sure to read the README because it contains a lot of information about the features and adjustable knobs in each file. The adjustments described in the README file are sufficient to cover most standard student projects.\n\nDuring your checkoff, you will be expected to explain to your professor how everything is intended to work, and (preferably) give your professor a live demonstration of data collection and display or (if necessary) display a set of slides which shows your measured data. The difference from Week 2 is that everything should be mounted, and not just breadboarded. You should be able to mount your electronics assembly in your box, power it from battery power, mount the box in your robot and demonstrate the ability to log data when it is in this configuration. Any mechanical modifications to the robot should be complete before the checkoff so that the instructors are verifying that your electronics assembly can be mounted inside of the final version of your robot.\nHere is a PDF of the Week 3 check-off list that we will use to evaluate your protoboards.\n\n\n\nDuring the fourth week you need to demonstrate that your AUV is watertight and capable of autonomous operation by measuring field data with it. Because GPS reception in the tank room is poor we’ll accept faked control loops or open loop control during tank room deployments. You are expected to test and (hopefully) launch your AUV at the pHake Lake at the Bernard Field Station during your regular section time. The main goal of these tests is to ensure that your sensors work in the field. The secondary goal is to evaluate your experimental data so you can make changes to ensure that you will be able to meet your experimental goals. Do not forget that seawater and lake water have very different salinities, conductivities, and densities. A neutrally buoyant AUV in pHake Lake will bob like a cork in the ocean.\nRemember that field deployments are often easier if you have a deployment checklist, so write one. Here is an example deployment checklist. The intent is that this checklist will prevent mistakes during your deployment; you’ll be thinking about enough things out in the field that you are very likely to forget about the details of the care and feeding of your sensor suite without a list to check against.\nYou will also submit an experimental plan. The plan must include the number of deployments you intend to do and the times and locations of those deployments. You should list the expected range of signals you expect to observe (based on theory or preliminary measurements) during the deployments. The document should show the planned robot trajectory for each deployment and discuss how the robot will be recovered (kayak, it comes back and we grab it, pool hook, etc.).\nThe main E80 Lab (Parsons B171) will be open from 12:30 pm - 1:00 pm this week so that you may retrieve your equipment. You must be at the side gate of Bernard Field Station by 1:15 pm; an instructor will meet the group at the gate at the start of your section. The teaching team will be out at BFS. This is one of the two chances that you’ll have to collect data in the field, and field data is required for your final report and presentation.\nTools and facilities will be available at BFS. A generator will be running power supplies, oscilloscopes, soldering irons, and other electronics. Multimeters and common hand tools will be available. Common supplies will be available too: heat shrink, glue, hot air guns, etc. A set of work tables will be set up beneath shaded tents. Sunscreen and water will be available during this deployment, but be sure you’ve eaten before you arrive. Faculty will announce a cancellation of the launch in the case of severe rain. Be sure to walk to the BFS gate in pairs and only cross at crosswalks.\nYou should show slides containing analyzed data at your checkoff. Be sure to overlay data sets that should be compared against one another and include analytical models to compare against on your plots.\nNOTE: It is possible to increase the logging time of your robot by increasing the FILE_BLOCK_COUNT value in Logger.h. This can help you to log data during long deployments.\n\n\n\nThe fifth week is your final chance to test and verify your deployment checklist and fix any flaws that were discovered at pHake Lake. You will have your regular section time to rebuild, retest, and modify your system to get more meaningful data by adjusting such things as amplifier gains and offsets, sampling rate, sensor location on the AUV, and deployment times of your sensor. You will not have access to pHake Lake, but you will have access to the water tank during the week.\nThe final field deployment is on Saturday, 4/22/2023. We will take buses from Foothill Blvd just north of Parsons to Dana Point, leaving at 6:30 am sharp. If you miss the bus, you will have to find your own way to Dana Point.\nYou must have your robot and any supplies that your group plans to bring with you in order to be ready to load the bus. Attendance will be taken to ensure that the bus doesn’t leave anyone behind at the end of the day, so make sure you are counted in the morning and you tell us if you are leaving separately from the bus.\nSunscreen, water and some snack/lunch food (pizza, granola bars, chips) will be provided. The same facilities as the lake deployment will be available. In addition, we will provide freshwater buckets and rice for recovering flooded robots.\nFaculty will announce a cancellation of the launch in the case of severe rain. The launch may be rescheduled for Sunday in that case.\nVideos have been recorded to give students a sense of the following environment characteristics:\n\nWater outside the harbor: Exercise great care if you want to operate a robot here. Most AUVs will be trashed. Watch this video.\nCurrents close to docks: This video shows the worst I saw. In this video, no motors are turned on.\nNormal AUV navigation in the harbor: This video shows it is possible.\nWater clarity: Get an idea of what you can see by watching this video.\n\nYour deliverables are slides with updated data from your deployment, which you will share with your instructors during your checkoffs at Dana Point. You are not allowed to do any deployments after launch day, so use this week well!\n\n\n\nThere are no deliverables during the sixth week of the project, but professors will be available to help you analyze data from your robot deployments. The experiments that you may conduct are limited, and the spirit of the restrictions is that you may only conduct small, in-lab forensic experiments to figure out problems if things went wrong.\nSpecifically:\n\nYou may not take any measurements underwater; you’re confined to “lab.”\nYou may not build or measure new sensors: if it didn’t work during a deployment then we’re not interested in measurements from it.\n\nYou should focus your efforts on analyzing your data and forensic analysis of failures in your sensors. If a small experiment would verify a forensic assumption or explain a quirk in your data, then you should feel free to carry it out. (For example, a team once needed to see how their measurements from an LED varied with angle, and they took their still functional sensor outside and waved it around to take that measurement.) When in doubt, ask an instructor.\nYour report is due at the end of this week.\n\n\n\nOn presentation day you will give a fifteen-minute, in-person presentation followed by ten minutes of questions and answers. This presentation should be aimed at a technically competent audience with diverse training backgrounds that is unfamiliar with the details of your project. (e.g.: The audience is a group of professional engineers from different disciplines.) You should imagine the presentation is being given to employers or peers at a conference, which means that you should hold yourself to high standards of professionalism: practice until the presentation is smooth and well-polished, think carefully about the story your visual aids are telling, ensure that the visual aids are readable and high quality, and dress in traditional business or business casual clothing. Every member of the team should participate in the presentation.\nHere is the rubric.\nSuccessful presentations often include discussions of:\n\nScience and/or engineering goals\nSensors and mechanical modifications to achieve those goals\nDesign process and calculations\nPre-deployment modeling and expected measurements\nData processing\nComparisons between modeling and measured data\nInterpretation of these results\nRecommendations for future work\n\nThe questions during the Q&A portion of your presentation will come from both the general technical audience and your instructors. They will range from straightforward to very detailed. Be sure to prepare by practicing fielding pointed questions and by cultivating a comprehensive understanding of your work. Preparing supplementary slides which you can deploy for common questions can help you during the Q&A.\nThe presentation schedule is available here. Please be at least ten minutes early to your presentation.\n\n\n\nEach team is responsible for submitting a report on their deployments in IEEE format. The report has a maximum length of ten pages including figures and appendices. Your purpose is to convey your experiments, your apparatus and your results. You should assume your audience is made of technical professionals of diverse backgrounds (i.e.: not all instructors of the course) who are unfamiliar with your specific project. You should write the report such that a reader could replicate your experiment and compare their results to yours. Note that this is a different audience than the video presentation. This rubric is the rubric which will be used to grade the reports.\nHere are a few tips for good report writing:\n\nThe main body is often most digestible if it is written in several sections. Which sections are included and the ordering of your will depend on the specifics of the experiment, but some common, important topics are provided in the modified rubric. If it is impossible to address every point in the modified rubric while staying inside the page limit then (1) make your writing more compact by using mathematical notation, tables or figures and (2) prioritize what is most important for your report.\nBe sure to follow the practices of scientific writing: use quantifiable descriptions instead of vague adjectives (“a 25% change” instead of a “a big change”), make sure all plots have labeled axes with units, make sure text in figures and tables is large enough to read, don’t use the first person (including cheats like “the team did X”) and minimize passive voice by making the experiment or artifact the subject of your sentences.\nMake sure to do some pre-writing to organize your text. Decide what topics you want in the report and where you want to put them before you start writing. Don’t talk about topics in the wrong sections or repeat yourself unnecessarily.\nDon’t forget that your writing style has a huge impact on how your work is received. Make a careful editing pass to be sure that each sentence says what you mean it to say. Then make a second editing pass for spelling, punctuation, common grammatical errors (especially tense mismatch, which is endemic), and gracefulness of language.\n\nHere are some examples of student reports and a well-written Tech Memo (c/o Prof. Spjut, don’t mind the non-IEEE formatting).\nA rough draft of your final report is due at XX. The final draft is due at XX."

    "text": "The final project for this class is deploying your AUV in open water in order to complete an experiment of your design. This project offers many opportunities for creativity: there are a wide variety of interesting things in the ocean that can be measured. For example, environmental or scientific quantities (e.g., water quality, distribution of temperature, salinity, turbidity) and observation of marine life are good options, as are engineering properties such as sensor accuracy, battery life, sensor or craft mechanical durability, velocity vs. power, controller accuracy, or measuring the structural strains that large motors apply to the robots. Get creative! We look forward to seeing what you come up with.\nThe minimum requirements of the project are as follows:\n\nYour robot must be autonomously deployed to take measurements without human intervention.\nThe deployment must last at least one minute and the robot must actively control its position during this minute.\nThis deployment must end at a place where the robot can be recovered.\nYour sensor package must be deployed on or from your AUV, either in the water or in the air.\nYour sensor package must use at least three sensors with at least two unique electrical interfaces.\nThe IMU, GPS, and motor current sensors that are already installed on the robot do not count towards this requirement, but they may be used as part of your data collection and analysis.\nAny sensors, including the ones you’ve installed or used as part of any of the labs, are fair game for this project. The extra-credit sections of labs are a good source for sensors.\n\nThis project is structured as a set of cumulative deliverables which will help you gather data in time to complete the project. These deliverables are summarized below. Each deliverable requires that each team be checked off by two faculty members during your usual lab section. The details of what documentation or hardware demonstrations are required for the checkoff each week are included in the sections below. The team needs to check off with their section professor and a second professor. The second professors will be available for some portion of every afternoon and on Friday (Teams from sections 1 and 3 may check off with your 2 section professors). Be prepared for a rigorous design review at each checkoff.\nIn addition to the extra credit sections in the labs, there is a set of reference designs for sensors and equipment. Feel free to use them as the basis for your own sensors and equipment. There are also many Arduino tutorials and an Elegoo User Guide to help you get started with your hardware.\nSensor deployments are intended to take place during weeks 4 and 5 of the project: Week 4 deployment will be at the Bernard Field Station’s pHake Lake during your regular section time and week 5 deployment will be at the Dana Point Baby Beach on Saturday 4/22/2023.\nAfter the deployments, students are responsible for a set of final deliverables: A rough draft of your final report is due at 11:59 PM on 4/28/23. The final draft is due at 11:59 PM on 5/3/2023 (submission will be accepted on Sakai) and a final presentation on 5/3/2023. The requirements for the final deliverables are discussed below."

    "title": "Project",
    "section": "",
    "text": "During the first lab section of your project you will need to produce a project proposal. The project proposal is made up of four parts: a budget indicating what you intend to buy for the project, a one-page maximum written description of your experiment, a detailed schematic showing how you will install your new sensors, and a mechanical drawing showing how you plan to mount or ruggedize the sensors for water submersion. Take a look at this example proposal to see what we’re looking for.\nYou will need to price the sensors and mechanical parts (easiest online) in order to make an accurate budget. You are expected to have selected parts for your experiment before submitting the budget. Selecting these parts will depend on your experimental design: does your motor have enough torque to overcome the surf? Does your pressure sensor have the maximum ratings necessary to achieve the depth you desire? Common vendors include Digikey, McMaster-Carr, JameCo, SparkFun, AdaFruit and many others. The faculty will not approve any budgets greater than $50 (including taxes and shipping). Supplies in the E80 lab don’t count towards your budget limit (and remember that there are some links to get you started on the final set of lecture slides and the section above). Some of the supplies, notably speakers and microphones, are available for temporary checkout for prototyping but not for permanent installation. These supplies are cheap enough that we expect you to buy your own for permanent installation.\nThe one-page description of your project should lay out your scientific and/or engineering goals and describe how your sensor system will help you meet those goals. There are a few specific points that it should address:\n\nIt should answer the question, “Why would anyone do this project?” or “Why should I care about your results?”\nIt should outline your hypothesis and what you’re comparing it to: what is the x of your experiment, what is the y and what two x-y curves are you comparing? If you need to cite literature to establish your scientific relationship, then don’t forget you can access papers through Mudd’s network.\nIt should state the sensors you are using and describe how they relate to your scientific goals. Will they require any exceptional mechanical, electrical or software design?\nIt should convince the reader that you considered a number of design alternatives when you picked your project. The minimum bar for doing this is including five two-line project descriptions for projects that you considered but did not pursue.\nIt should outline requests for specific launch times or locations for your robot. There are two locations we can launch in Dana Point: the public beach and the Ocean Institute pier. We have a limited number of launch slots on the pier: two teams can launch in each half hour slot from 8:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. If your scientific goals would benefit from a particular launch time slot or slots on the pier, then you should request those slots in this project description. If some time slots are oversubscribed, we will award them randomly. We will prioritize giving every team that wants one a deployment off the pier over giving one team multiple deployments.\n\nYour schematic should be detailed and thorough and show every wire, resistor, capacitor (don’t forget bypass capacitors) and power source that you intend to connect in order to get your sensor signals onto your MTB. You should consider the voltage swing each component will provide and carefully design your analog front end and power supply so that these voltages are appropriate for the Teensy. Annotating voltage swings on your schematic is a good way to keep track of these design choices. You will be asked about every component on your schematic, so be prepared to back up your decisions with calculations or reference designs from the datasheets.\nYou may find the design files for the PCBs you will use helpful while coming up with your schematic, so they are linked below. The CAD files for each board are viewable usingKiCAD. Also, consider re-reading the Introduction to the E80 Motherboard document from lab 1.\n\nMotherboard (schematic, layout, CAD files)\nProtoboard (schematic, layout, CAD files)\n\nYou used the motherboard in labs 1, 2 and 7, so you should be familiar with it. All of your new electronics will be assembled on a new board called the protoboard, which has been designed to resemble a breadboard. Note that there are special areas on the protoboard layout for voltage regulators; you have battery power available to your protoboard but no regulated voltage supplies, so you will need to use these areas to add voltage regulators. The screw holes on all of the boards are grounded. Connections from the motherboard to protoboard will be made with a ribbon cable as shown here and here.\nYour mechanical drawings should indicate sensor locations and be sufficient to convince a skeptical professor that your intended mechanical modifications are physically possible. Include approximate calculations - mass, center of gravity, buoyancy, or torque for motors - where appropriate to justify that these modifications serve your experimental goals. Especially include calculations if you think a professor will challenge you on the feasibility of your modification. (“e.g.: Can you really submerge an air filled tank with THAT motor?”) Be sure to look up datasheets for motors if necessary.\nRemember, you have $50 per team to spend towards your project. A few important notes on spending:\n\nAll purchases must be approved by your section instructor, who will initial your purchase requests on the google spreadsheet.\nYou must make all purchases to be shipped to the Engineering Department.\nOnce your section instructor has approved your purchase, the designated purchaser may use the online department form New Purchase Order Request Form to make the purchase request.\nOn the purchase request form, be sure to include your team number and section number.\nPlan for a relatively long lead time, around a week.\nOn the purchase request form, put Professor Brake as the professor to approve the purchase request.\nDO NOT FORGET TAXES AND SHIPPING COSTS WHEN CONSIDERING YOUR BUDGET.\n\nFaculty use this checklist when checking students off for this week, so feel free to review your proposal against that list.\nThis is the list of parts available to you."

    "text": "There are no deliverables during the sixth week of the project, but professors will be available to help you analyze data from your robot deployments. The experiments that you may conduct are limited, and the spirit of the restrictions is that you may only conduct small, in-lab forensic experiments to figure out problems if things went wrong.\nSpecifically:\n\nYou may not take any measurements underwater; you’re confined to “lab.”\nYou may not build or measure new sensors: if it didn’t work during a deployment then we’re not interested in measurements from it.\n\nYou should focus your efforts on analyzing your data and forensic analysis of failures in your sensors. If a small experiment would verify a forensic assumption or explain a quirk in your data, then you should feel free to carry it out. (For example, a team once needed to see how their measurements from an LED varied with angle, and they took their still functional sensor outside and waved it around to take that measurement.) When in doubt, ask an instructor.\nYour report is due at the end of this week."

    "text": "On presentation day you will give a fifteen-minute, in-person presentation followed by ten minutes of questions and answers. This presentation should be aimed at a technically competent audience with diverse training backgrounds that is unfamiliar with the details of your project. (e.g.: The audience is a group of professional engineers from different disciplines.) You should imagine the presentation is being given to employers or peers at a conference, which means that you should hold yourself to high standards of professionalism: practice until the presentation is smooth and well-polished, think carefully about the story your visual aids are telling, ensure that the visual aids are readable and high quality, and dress in traditional business or business casual clothing. Every member of the team should participate in the presentation.\nHere is the rubric.\nSuccessful presentations often include discussions of:\n\nScience and/or engineering goals\nSensors and mechanical modifications to achieve those goals\nDesign process and calculations\nPre-deployment modeling and expected measurements\nData processing\nComparisons between modeling and measured data\nInterpretation of these results\nRecommendations for future work\n\nThe questions during the Q&A portion of your presentation will come from both the general technical audience and your instructors. They will range from straightforward to very detailed. Be sure to prepare by practicing fielding pointed questions and by cultivating a comprehensive understanding of your work. Preparing supplementary slides which you can deploy for common questions can help you during the Q&A.\nThe presentation schedule is available here. Please be at least ten minutes early to your presentation."

    "text": "Each team is responsible for submitting a report on their deployments in IEEE format. The report has a maximum length of ten pages including figures and appendices. Your purpose is to convey your experiments, your apparatus and your results. You should assume your audience is made of technical professionals of diverse backgrounds (i.e.: not all instructors of the course) who are unfamiliar with your specific project. You should write the report such that a reader could replicate your experiment and compare their results to yours. Note that this is a different audience than the video presentation. This rubric is the rubric which will be used to grade the reports.\nHere are a few tips for good report writing:\n\nThe main body is often most digestible if it is written in several sections. Which sections are included and the ordering of your will depend on the specifics of the experiment, but some common, important topics are provided in the modified rubric. If it is impossible to address every point in the modified rubric while staying inside the page limit then (1) make your writing more compact by using mathematical notation, tables or figures and (2) prioritize what is most important for your report.\nBe sure to follow the practices of scientific writing: use quantifiable descriptions instead of vague adjectives (“a 25% change” instead of a “a big change”), make sure all plots have labeled axes with units, make sure text in figures and tables is large enough to read, don’t use the first person (including cheats like “the team did X”) and minimize passive voice by making the experiment or artifact the subject of your sentences.\nMake sure to do some pre-writing to organize your text. Decide what topics you want in the report and where you want to put them before you start writing. Don’t talk about topics in the wrong sections or repeat yourself unnecessarily.\nDon’t forget that your writing style has a huge impact on how your work is received. Make a careful editing pass to be sure that each sentence says what you mean it to say. Then make a second editing pass for spelling, punctuation, common grammatical errors (especially tense mismatch, which is endemic), and gracefulness of language.\n\nHere are some examples of student reports and a well-written Tech Memo (c/o Prof. Spjut, don’t mind the non-IEEE formatting).\nA rough draft of your final report is due at XX. The final draft is due at XX."
